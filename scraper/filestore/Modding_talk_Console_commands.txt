Commands overhauled in 1.6
Looks like console commands have changed substantially in 1.6. They have moved to a separate script (DebugCommands.cs). Several commands are working oddly (e.g., itemnamed), others have been deleted (e.g. everythingshop). Page will need a full overhaul. OnionNinja (talk) 08:20, 10 April 2024 (UTC)
Only one example but befriendpets has been added in 1.6. Clara (talk) 22:25, 15 July 2024 (UTC)
