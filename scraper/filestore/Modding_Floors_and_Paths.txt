This page covers the data format for craftable floors & paths. This is an advanced guide for mod developers
Data Format
You can add or customize craftable floors & paths by editing the Data/FloorsAndPaths asset.
This consists of a string → model lookup, where the key matches the ID field and the value is a model with these fields:
field effect
ID The unique string ID for this floor/path.
ItemId The unqualified item ID for the corresponding object-type item.
Texture The asset name for the texture (under the game's Content folder) when the flooring is applied or the path is placed. Use \ (or \\ in JSON) to separate name segments if needed. For example, the vanilla tilesheet is TerrainFeatures\Flooring.
Corner The top-left pixel position for the sprite within the Texture spritesheet, specified as a model with X and Y fields.
PlacementSound The audio cue ID played when the item is applied/placed (e.g. axchop used by Wood Floor).
FootstepSound The audio cue ID played when the player steps on the tile (e.g. woodyStep used by Wood Floor).
WinterTexture
Corner (Optional) Equivalent to Texture and Corner, but applied if the current location is in winter.
RemovalSound (Optional) The audio cue ID played when the item is unapplied or picked up. Defaults to the same sound as PlacementSound.
RemovalDebrisType (Optional) The type of cosmetic debris particles to 'splash' from the tile when the item is unapplied or picked up. The defined values are 0 (copper), 2 (iron), 4 (coal), 6 (gold), 8 (coins), 10 (iridium), 12 (wood), 14 (stone), 32 (big stone), and 34 (big wood). Default 14 (stone).
ShadowType (Optional) The type of shadow to draw under the tile sprite. Default None.
The possible values are:
value effect
None Don't draw a shadow.
Square Draw a shadow under the entire tile.
Contoured raw a shadow that follows the lines of the path sprite.
ConnectType (Optional) When drawing the flooring across multiple tiles, how the flooring sprite for each tile is selected. Defaults to Default.
The possible values are:
value usage
Default For normal floors, intended to cover large square areas. This uses some logic to draw inner corners.
Path For floors intended to be drawn as narrow paths. These are drawn without any consideration for inner corners.
CornerDecorated For floors that have a decorative corner. Use CornerSize to change the size of this corner.
Random For floors that don't connect. When placed, one of the tiles is randomly selected.
CornerSize (Optional) The pixel size of the decorative border when the ConnectType field is set to CornerDecorated or Default.
FarmSpeedBuff (Optional) The speed boost applied to the player, on the farm only, when they're walking on paths of this type. Negative values are ignored. Default 0.1.
