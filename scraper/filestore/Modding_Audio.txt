Overview
'Audio' covers both sound effects (like the boop sound when clicking a button) and music tracks. An audio track or sound effect is called a cue, which may have multiple audio files to randomize which one plays each time the cue starts.
The game loads its initial cues from the Content/XACT folder (which can't be edited directly), and then adds/edits cues based on the audio data (which can be edited through Content Patcher or SMAPI).
Sound effects are played by audio cue ID, while music is selected using this priority list:
specific audio cue IDs in some cases (e.g. MainTheme on the title screen);
music data in Data/Locations;
the Music map property (deprecated);
music data in Data/LocationContexts.
Audio data
You can add or edit cues by editing the Data/AudioChanges asset. New cues are added to the game's soundbank, so they can be used anywhere normal audio can be used (e.g. the Music map property).
Data format
The Data/AudioChanges asset consists of a string → model lookup, where the key matches the ID, and the value is a model with the fields below.
Entries in this asset describe an override applied to the soundbank. The override is applied permanently for the current game session, even if the asset is edited to remove it. Overriding a cue will reset all values to the ones specified.
field effect
ID The unique string ID for the audio cue, used when playing the sound in-game.
FilePaths A list of absolute file paths (not asset names) from which to load the audio. Each file can be .ogg or .wav. If you list multiple paths, a random one will be chosen each time it's played.
Category The audio category, which determines which volume slider in the game options applies. This should be one of Default, Music, Sound, Ambient, or Footsteps (see a description of each category). Defaults to Default.
StreamedVorbis Whether the audio should be streamed from disk when it's played, instead of being loaded into memory ahead of time. This is only possible for Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) files, which otherwise will be decompressed in-memory on load. Default false.
This is a tradeoff between memory usage and performance, so you should consider which value is best for each audio cue:
value effect
true Reduces memory usage when the audio cue isn't active, but increases performance impact when it's played. Playing the audio multiple times will multiply the memory and performance impact while they're active, since each play will stream a new instance. Recommended for longer audio cues (like music or ambient noise), or cues that are rarely used in a specific scenario (e.g. a sound that only plays once in an event).
false Increases memory usage (since it's fully loaded into memory), but reduces performance impact when it's played. It can be played any number of times without affecting memory or performance (it'll just play the cached audio). Recommended for sound effects, or short audio cues that are played occasionally.
Looped Whether the audio cue loops continuously until stopped. Default false.
UseReverb Whether to apply a reverb effect to the audio. Default false.
CustomFields The custom fields for this entry.
Category list
Each audio cue is assigned to one of five categories, which affects which volume slider in the game options applies to it:
internal ID name description
1 Default This is an unused category, and should generally be avoided.
2 Music For music tracks, to be regulated with the in-game music volume option.
3 Sound For sound effects, to be regulated with the in-game sound volume option.
4 Ambient For ambient background sounds, like wind, rain or machine whirring, that can play in the background of a scene.
5 Footsteps For step sounds, such as player or horse footsteps.
Audio file format
The game only supports .ogg and .wav formats. If you have .mp3 files you'd like to use in-game, you can convert the audio file to .wav or .ogg with audio software such as Audacity. For smaller-sized sounds such as sound effects, you can use a .wav file, but for audio such as music that has a large file size, use a compressed .ogg file.
Make sure the file size of your music is relatively small (preferably around 2-4MB). The bigger the file, the longer the game will freeze for when loading your newly added song. To reduce the size of your song, you can convert it to .ogg and add compression to the sound file. The more compression your audio has, the smaller the file will be, but the quality will diminish noticeably if you compress the audio too much.
If you're patching many sounds at once, keep the file size of your mod in mind, because the more sounds you include, the longer it will take for people to download your mod.
Example
This content pack adds a new music cue to the game, and plays it when the player enters the bus stop:
{
    "Format": "2.5.0",
    "Changes": [
        // add music cue
        {
            "Action": "EditData",
            "Target": "Data/AudioChanges",
            "Entries": {
                "{{ModId}}_Music": {
                    "ID": "{{ModId}}_Music",
                    "Category": "Music",
                    "FilePaths": [ "{{AbsoluteFilePath: assets/music.ogg}}" ],
                    "StreamedVorbis": true,
                    "Looped": true
                }
            }
        },

        // add to bus stop
        {
            "Action": "EditData",
            "Target": "Data/Locations",
            "Fields": {
                "BusStop": {
                    "MusicDefault": "{{ModId}}_Music"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Review audio
Unpack audio files
The base game's audio is stored in the Content/XACT folder in the form of soundbanks, which store all of the game's sounds and music. The two soundbank files available are Wave Bank(1.4).xwb and Wave Bank.xwb.
Audio files can be extracted and browsed with an XWB extractor:
tool name platforms supported notes
unxwb Windows, macOS Extracts an XWB soundbank into .wav files and hex codes. A straightforward open and extract utility.
use unwxnb on macOS 
VGMStream plugin for foobar2000 sound player Windows Views XWB soundbanks with integer codes and many in-game codes included in filenames, and has a very convenient file browser. (For some reason, it increments audio IDs by 1, and each audio cue is looped.)
XACTTool Windows Extracts an XWB soundbank into .wav files and integer codes. Can also manipulate soundbanks. Command-line only.
See the full track list below.
Identify audio in-game
For music tracks, you can install the Now Playing mod (see the mod description for info on adding the music ID to the message). A HUD message will be shown in-game when music starts.
For sound effects, you can enter debug logSounds in the SMAPI console window. This will log info for each sound played in-game, including positional data if applicable. See console commands for more info.
Track list
These are the raw soundbank IDs for music and sounds exported from the game data (see the talk page for the export code).
A few notes about the table columns:
The name is what you'd use in-game (e.g., with the Music map property or the Game1.changeMusicTrack method). When a name is repeated with different soundbank IDs, the game will choose a random sound each time you play it.
The wavebank indicates whether the audio is from Content/XACT/Wave Bank.xwb or Content/XACT/Wave Bank(1.4).xwb. Each wavebank has its own set of soundbank IDs, but names don't overlap.
The soundtrack index is the sound's position in the soundbank. The hexadecimal version matches the track's filename if you unpack the wavebank using unxwb.
The description column is filled in manually for the wiki.

Manage audio in C#
The game mostly handles sound effects through the Game1.sounds field. This has low-level methods like PlayLocal, PlayAll, GetVolumeForDistance, etc.
However, you should rarely call Game1.sounds directly. Instead the game has four main methods for playing a sound effect:
method usage
Game1.playSound Play a sound for the current player only, which isn't synced in multiplayer and isn't affected by location or distance. This is mainly used for UI and menu sounds.
For example:
// for UI elements (e.g. crafting an item)
Game1.playSound("crafting");
GameLocation.localSound
GameLocation.playSound Play a sound for the current player (localSound) or all players (playSound) if they're in this location.
You can optionally specify...
a tile position (which attenuates volume for each player based on their distance from the sound's source);
and/or pitch (from 0 to 2400 with intervals of 100 between every half step, where 1200 is the default pitch).
For example:
// play sound for the current player if they're anywhere on the farm
Game1.getFarm().localSound("doorCreak");

// play sound for the current player if they're on the farm near the mailbox (fading with distance)
Farm farm = Game1.getFarm();
farm.localSound("doorCreak", farm.GetMainMailboxPosition());

// play sound for all players on the farm near the mailbox (fading with distance), with a -200 pitch shift
Farm farm = Game1.getFarm();
farm.playSound("doorCreak", farm.GetMainMailboxPosition(), 1000);
DelayedAction.playSoundAfterDelay Play a sound for the current or all players after a specified delay in milliseconds. You can optionally specify a location, tile position, and pitch (which works the same way as the GameLocation methods). You can call this method repeatedly to play multiple sounds (e.g. for a sequence of sounds with different delays).
For example:
// play sound for the current player after 1.5 seconds, no matter where they are
DelayedAction.playSoundAfterDelay("thunder_small", 1500);

// play sound for all players on the farm after 1.5 seconds, fading with distance from the mailbox
Farm farm = Game1.getFarm();
DelayedAction.playSoundAfterDelay("doorCreak", farm, farm.GetMainMailboxPosition());

// play sound for the current player only if they'rte on the farm after 1.5 seconds, fading with distance from the mailbox
Farm farm = Game1.getFarm();
DelayedAction.playSoundAfterDelay("doorCreak", farm, farm.GetMainMailboxPosition(), local: true);
To add/edit audio, see audio data above.
