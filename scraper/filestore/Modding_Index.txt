Mods are packages of files which change Stardew Valley in some way. Mods can add features (like showing NPCs on the map), change game mechanics (like making fences decay more slowly), make cosmetic changes (like making your house look like a hobbit home), and much more.

Using XNB mods (not recommended)
Creating mods
Making mods can be broadly divided into two categories: C# mods and content packs (formatted text files that rely on a framework C# mod). Content packs can make new NPCs, edit maps, add new items, add shops, and more, while C# mods can change fundamental game mechanics. Usually it’s easiest to start with making content packs, since you don't need to learn how to program in C#.
