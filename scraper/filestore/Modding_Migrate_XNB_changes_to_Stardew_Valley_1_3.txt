Overview
Content Patcher mods
Many Content Patcher mods will work fine in Stardew Valley 1.3. For each Target you specify, check update impact below. If the file isn't listed (or the 'Content Patcher' column is empty), then no change is needed. If the file changed, compare your edits to the latest version of the file and adjust if needed.
XNB mods
Updating XNB mods can be tedious. For each XNB file you replace, check update impact below. If the file isn't listed, then no change is needed. If the file changed, it's often easiest to simply restart from the latest version and manually copy each change from your modified version. Make sure your changes are still compatible!
Note that XNB mods are no longer recommended. If you need to update an XNB mod, migrating to Content Patcher is strongly recommended to reduce the impact of future updates.
Update impact
Here's a summary of the XNB files which changed in Stardew Valley 1.3.
Notes:
This ignores text changes in non-English files for simplicity.
New content files aren't listed, since they won't impact existing mods and to avoid spoiling some surprises.
XNB mods are disproportionately affected, since they replace the entire file. Content Patcher packs are typically unaffected unless they replace the entire file (in which case see the XNB mod column).
I don't know what changed in affected map files (if anything), only that the files are different.
Shorthand:
'broken' means removing new content or potentially important changes, or potentially causing significant display bugs. This is a broad category — the game may work fine without it or crash, depending how it uses that specific content.
'mostly unaffected' means mods will only be affected if they edit specific entries or fields.
Blank means zero expected impact.
