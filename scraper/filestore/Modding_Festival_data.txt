Data file
Each festival has a data file located at Content/Data/Festivals/<season><day of month>. The game uses this asset to determine whether there's a festival today (if the asset exists), where and when it happens, and NPC placement/dialogue/behavior.
Raw data
The festival data file can be unpacked for editing. For example, here's the raw data from Content/Data/Festivals/fall27 as of 1.5.4 for reference:
Expand
Data 
Format
field key explanation
name The festival name. This is used in display text like the calendar tooltip or the festival-is-ready message.
conditions When and where the festival takes place. The format is <location>/<start time> <end time>, where <location> is the internal location name and the times are specified in 26-hour format (i.e., 600 for 6am to 2600 for 2am).
mainEvent The main event script. This is triggered when the player asks the festival host (usually Lewis) to begin the festival. This is absent for events that do not have a prompt or where speaking to Lewis does not trigger a new scene.
shop The items the festival shop sells. See shop format below.
set-up The event script that's run when the player first enters the festival. This includes moving the player to the festival map. This field supports year variants.
Set-Up_additionalCharacters NPCs to spawn when the festival loads. This is specified as four space-delimited fields in the form <NPC name> <tile X> <tile Y> <facing direction>, repeated for each NPC to add with a / between each NPC. The <facing direction> can be one of up or 0, down or 2, left or 3, and right or 1. These are additional to the NPCs spawned via the map file. For example, this adds Abigail and Leah side-by-side facing down:
"Set-Up_additionalCharacters": "Abigail 15 6 down/Leah 16 6 down"
This field supports year variants.
MainEvent_additionalCharacters, or
Main-Event_additionalCharacters for the Festival of Ice NPCs to spawn when the festival's mainEvent script is run. Just like mainEvent, this is absent for events that do not have a prompt to start a new scene. The format is identical to Set-Up_additionalCharacters, above.
This field supports year variants.
<NPC name>_roommate The dialog line the named NPC will say when the player talks to them, if they're roommates with the player. This field supports year variants, doesn't work on the Flower Dance festival, and doesn't support #$e# breaks. If not specified, the <NPC name>_spouse will be used next.
<NPC name>_spouse The dialog line the named NPC will say when the player talks to them, if they're married to the player. This field supports year variants, doesn't work on the Flower Dance festival, and doesn't support #$e# breaks.
<NPC name> The dialog line the named NPC will say when the player talks to them, if <NPC name>_spouse doesn't exist or apply. This field supports year variants.
Any other entry is event data for a cutscene during the festival. In some cases like the Luau, these are linked together when played in the game.
Year variants
Several fields allow annual variants (documented in the table above). These work by adding _y<year variant> to the end of key, where the <year variant> is an incrementing number starting at 1 with no upper limit. For example, two entries set-up_y1 and set-up_y2 will alternate (set-up_y1 in year 1, set-up_y2 in year 2, set-up_y1 in year 3, etc). If year variants are defined for a key, the original key is ignored (e.g., set-up will never be used if set-up_y* entries are defined).
ⓘ
It is recommended to use the year variants for the Set-Up_additionalCharacters and MainEvent_additionalCharacters fields, even if you don't wish to spawn your custom NPC in different locations on odd and even years.
These keys are global to the festival data, and if any mod appends to them, the game will use those keys instead of the non-variant keys. This will cause any NPCs not using the year variant keys to fail to spawn.
Shop format
The shop data for a festival is stored as four space-separated values in the format <item type> <item ID> <cost> <count available>, which is repeated for each item. Field formats:
field explanation
<item type> The item type. The valid values are B or Boots (boots), BL or Blueprint (blueprint), BBL, BBl or BigBlueprint (big blueprint), BO or BigObject (bigcraftable object), F (furniture), H or Hat (hat), O or Object (object), R or Ring (ring), or W or Weapon (weapon).
<item id> The item's spritesheet index.
<cost> The purchase price in gold. For seeds, this is modified based on the profit margin.
<count available> How many of that item can be purchased from the shop, or -1 for unlimited.
Map
Many festivals use a separate map file located in the Content/Maps folder. The map to use is specified in the data file's set-up field using the changeToTemporaryMap command.
Spawned NPCs
ⓘ
This is fragile and not recommended for custom NPCs or festivals.
Consider using the data file's Set-Up_additionalCharacters field instead.
NPCs can be added to festivals using map tile indexes on a specific layer. This is enabled in the data file's set-up field using the loadActors <layer name> command. For each tile which exists on the layer, the tile index is mapped to the NPC's index in the Data\NPCDispositions asset multiplied by four, with an offset which determines the facing direction (0 = up, 1 = right, 2 = down, or 3 = left).
For example, let's say the layer has a tile with tilesheet index 61. That's the NPC at index 61 / 4 = 15 in Data\NPCDispositions, i.e., the 16th NPC, i.e., Leah. The offset is 61 % 4 = 1, so she's facing right. When the festival is loaded, Leah will be added to that tile position facing right.
Hardcoded logic
Several vanilla events have hardcoded scripted logic in the game code. For example, Lewis judging the farmer's grange display at the Stardew Valley Fair is handled in the game code, not the content assets documented here.
The Night Market is also handled differently from other festivals. While there are separate Night Market maps, the NPC data doesn't exist on these. Instead, NPCs dynamically enter and leave the festival via schedule data.
