This page explains how the game stores and parses quests. This is an advanced guide for mod developers.
Raw data
Scripted quests are stored in Content\Data\Quests.xnb, which can be unpacked for editing. Here's the raw data as of 1.5.4 for reference:
Data 
Format
Each quest's key must be a unique positive integer. When adding a custom quest, prefixing the ID with your Nexus ID is recommended to help reduce mod conflicts.
The entry for each quest contains these slash-delimited quest fields:
Index Description
0 Type (e.g., Location, Basic, LostItem, etc)
1 Title
2 Quest details/flavor text
3 Hint/condition
4 Solution/trigger
5 Next quest (-1 if none)
6 Gold (0 if none)
7 Reward description (Only if Gold is not -1. Apparently unused?)
8 Cancellable
9 (Optional) reaction text
When using the ItemDelivery quest type, you can specify an item quantity after the item ID.
Ex: "5200": "ItemDelivery/Rock Candy/Abigail wants you to bring her several amethysts./Bring Abigail 10 amethysts./Abigail 66 10/-1/300/-1/true/Thanks, these look delicious!"
Here is the string in an easy to edit format:
ID(number): Type/Title/flavor text/Hint/Solution/Next quest (-1 if none)/Gold (0 if none)/Reward Description/Cancellable/Reaction Text(optional)
