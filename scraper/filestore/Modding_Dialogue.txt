Dialogue data
Character dialogue is stored in many different files: The Characters\Dialogue directory is where the majority of NPC-specific dialogue is stored. Data\ExtraDialogue.xnb, Strings\Characters.xnb, Strings\Events.xnb, Strings\SpeechBubbles.xnb, and Strings\StringsFromCSFiles.xnb contain various other pieces of dialogue, some generic, and some NPC-specific.
Characters\Dialogue directory
Characters\Dialogue\<NPC>.xnb
An NPC's named file in Character\Dialogue contains most of their dialogue. The game will choose dialogue from one of the sections below, in the order shown here.
Special dialogue
There are a few predefined keys for specific cases:
key format description
breakUp An NPC's response to being broken up with by giving them a wilted bouquet.
divorced Dialogue shown when you speak to your divorced spouse.
DumpsterDiveComment Shown when the NPC catches the player digging through a trash can. Defaults to a generic dialogue based on the NPC's age.
GreenRain Dialogue during the Green Rain event in the first year.
GreenRain_2 Dialogue during the Green Rain event in the second and subsequent years.
HitBySlingshot Shown when the player shoots them with a slingshot. Defaults to a generic dialogue.
<location>_Entry Possible dialogue lines shown above the NPC's name when they enter the named <location>, with a 50% chance. This dialogue entry can contain multiple options separated by /; the game will randomly choose one to display.
Example: SeedShop_Entry: "Hi, Pierre!/Now, what do I need.../Ah, that looks good!/Makin' my special sauce tonight!/Pierre! What's fresh?/Pierre! Waddya got for me?"
Note: This key is not to be confused with Modding:Dialogue#Speech_bubbles.
Resort
Resort_Bar
Resort_Chair
Resort_Dance
Resort_Entering
Resort_Leaving
Resort_Shore
Resort_Towel
Resort_Umbrella
Resort_Wander Various dialogue keys used when an NPC is visiting the Ginger Island Resort.
SpouseFarmhouseClutter Shown by an NPC spouse when they couldn't pathfind to their kitchen standing spot in the farmhouse.
SpouseGiftJealous Shown by an NPC spouse if they become jealous after the player gives a gift to another NPC that the player is dating. Spouses have a 20-40% chance to become jealous of the gift-giving if the giftee is of the same gender as the spouse (unless it's the giftee's birthday). You can use {0} in the dialogue for the other NPC's name, and {1} for the gifted item name.
Spouse_MonstersInHouse Shown by an NPC spouse when they're in the farmhouse and there's a monster close to them.
SpouseStardrop Shown when receiving the stardrop from your spouse.
WipedMemory Shown the first time you talk to the NPC after erasing their memory using the Dark Shrine of Memory.
Item dialogue
These keys apply when you present an item to an NPC:
key format description
AcceptBirthdayGift_<id>
AcceptBirthdayGift_<tag>
AcceptBirthdayGift_<taste>_<context tag>
AcceptBirthdayGift_<taste>
AcceptBirthdayGift_Negative
AcceptBirthdayGift_Positive
AcceptBirthdayGift Shown when receiving a birthday gift from the player. If omitted, defaults to the generic translations for all NPCs. These keys will override AcceptGift_<id> and AcceptGift_<tag> even if the birthday key is less specific.
The first matching dialogue is used in this order:
by item ID (like AcceptBirthdayGift_(O)128);
by context tag (like AcceptBirthdayGift_category_fish);
by context tag and gift taste (see below for valid gift tastes);
by gift taste (one of AcceptBirthdayGift_Loved, AcceptBirthdayGift_Liked, AcceptBirthdayGift_Neutral, AcceptBirthdayGift_Disliked, or AcceptBirthdayGift_Hated);
AcceptBirthdayGift_Negative (hated or disliked gift) or AcceptBirthdayGift_Positive (neutral, liked, or loved gift);
for all items (via AcceptBirthdayGift).
AcceptBouquet Shown when the NPC accepts a bouquet from the player. Defaults to a generic dialogue.
AcceptGift_<id>
AcceptGift_<tag>
AcceptGift_<taste>_<context tag>
AcceptGift_<taste>
AcceptGift Shown when receiving a non-birthday gift from the player. If omitted, defaults to the dialogue in Data/NPCGiftTastes.
The first matching dialogue is used in this order:
by item ID (like AcceptGift_(O)128);
by context tag (like AcceptGift_category_fish);
by context tag and gift taste (see below for valid gift tastes);
by gift taste (one of Loved, Liked, Neutral, Disliked, Hated, Positive (neutral/liked/loved), or Negative (disliked/hated));
for all items (via AcceptGift).
MovieInvitation An NPC's response to being invited to the Movie Theater. If not defined, the NPC will use a generic line from Strings\Characters.xnb depending on the NPC's manners.
RejectBouquet_NotDatable
RejectBouquet_NpcAlreadyMarried
RejectBouquet_AlreadyAccepted_Engaged
RejectBouquet_AlreadyAccepted_Married
RejectBouquet_AlreadyAccepted
RejectBouquet_Divorced
RejectBouquet_Divorced
RejectBouquet_VeryLowHearts
RejectBouquet_LowHearts
RejectBouquet Shown when the NPC rejects a bouquet.
A specific dialogue is shown if possible:
RejectBouquet_NotDatable: the NPC isn't romanceable.
RejectBouquet_NpcAlreadyMarried: the NPC is already married to another player. You can use {0} in the dialogue for the other player's name.
RejectBouquet_AlreadyAccpeted_*: the NPC already accepted a bouquet from the player.
RejectBouquet_Divorced: the NPC won't accept this bouquet because you divorced them.
RejectBouquet_VeryLowHearts: you have less than 4 hearts with the NPC.
RejectBouquet_LowHearts: you have less than 8 hearts with the NPC.
If the specific dialogue isn't set, the game will use the RejectBouquet dialogue (if set), else it'll default to generic dialogue for each case.
RejectGift_Divorced Shown when the NPC rejects a gift because you divorced them.
RejectItem_<id>
RejectItem_<tag> If set, the NPC will refuse to accept any matching item and show this dialogue instead. This can be by item ID (like RejectItem_(O)128) or context tag (like RejectItem_category_fish). This can prevent gifting, movie tickets, bouquets, mermaid pendants, etc. However it won't prevent accepting an item for an active quest or special order.

Note: These dialogue keys will take precedence over the gift acceptance dialogue keys even if the rejection key is for a tag (less specific) and the acceptance key is for the ID (more specific). This means you cannot use these keys to reject a group of items (via a tag like category_gem, for example) and then use an AcceptGift_<id> to accept only one item from within that group. Instead, you must individually reject all the unwanted items within that group.
RejectMermaidPendant_AlreadyAccepted_Engaged
RejectMermaidPendant_AlreadyAccepted_Married
RejectMermaidPendant_AlreadyAccepted
RejectMermaidPendant_Divorced
RejectMermaidPendant_NeedHouseUpgrade
RejectMermaidPendant_NotDatable

RejectMermaidPendant_Under8Hearts
RejectMermaidPendant_Under10Hearts
RejectMermaidPendant_Under10Hearts_AskedAgain
RejectMermaidPendant
Shown when the NPC rejects a mermaid's pendant.
A specific dialogue is shown if possible. The cases are checked in this order:
RejectMermaidPendant_AlreadyAccepted_*: the player gives a mermaid's pendant to an NPC who already accepted one from them.
RejectMermaidPendant_PlayerWithSomeoneElse: the player is already engaged or married to someone else. You can use {0} in the dialogue for the player's spouse name.
RejectMermaidPendant_NotDatable: the NPC isn't romanceable.
RejectMermaidPendant_Divorced: you divorced them, so they won't accept gifts or proposals from you.
RejectMermaidPendant_NpcWithSomeoneElse: the NPC is already engaged or married to someone else. You can use {0} in the dialogue for the other player's name.
RejectMermaidPendant_Under8Hearts: you have under 8 hearts with the NPC.
RejectMermaidPendant_Under10Hearts: you have under 10 hearts with the NPC.
RejectMermaidPendant_Under10Hearts_AskedAgain: you have under 10 hearts with the NPC, and asked again after they already said no. (Defaults to the previous dialogue if not set.)
RejectMermaidPendant_NeedHouseUpgrade: you need to upgrade your house before they can accept.
If the specific dialogue isn't set, the game will use the RejectMermaidPendant dialogue (if set), else it'll default to generic dialogue for each case.
RejectMovieTicket_AlreadyInvitedBySomeoneElse
RejectMovieTicket_AlreadyWatchedThisWeek
RejectMovieTicket_Divorced
RejectMovieTicket_DontWantToSeeThatMovie
RejectMovieTicket Show when the NPC rejects a movie ticket.
A specific dialogue is shown if possible:

RejectMovieTicket_Divorced: you divorced the NPC, so they won't accept gifts from you.
RejectMovieTicket_DontWantToSeeThatMovie: the movie data marks that NPC as unwilling to watch it (e.g. kids for horror movies).
If the specific dialogue isn't set, the game will use the RejectMovieTicket dialogue (if set), else it'll default to generic dialogue for each case.
RejectRoommateProposal_AlreadyAccepted
RejectRoommateProposal_NpcWithSomeoneElse
RejectRoommateProposal_PlayerWithSomeoneElse
RejectRoommateProposal_LowFriendship
RejectRoommateProposal_SmallHouse
RejectRoommateProposal (Optional) Shown when the NPC rejects a roommate proposal because the player doesn't meet a specific requirement:
AlreadyAccepted: the NPC is already a roommate with this player.
NpcWithSomeoneElse: the NPC is already a roommate with another player.
PlayerWithSomeoneElse: the player making the proposal already has a roommate.
LowFriendship: the player doesn't have 10+ hearts with the NPC.
SmallHouse: the player hasn't upgraded their house yet.
If the specific dialogue isn't set, the game will use the RejectRoommateProposal dialogue (if set), else it'll default to generic dialogue.
accept_<item_id>
reject_<item_id> (Obsolete) These are specialized keys meant for the pirate lady quest. Use AcceptGift_* and RejectItem_* instead.
Festival dialogue
key format description
Fair_Judging Shown at the Stardew Valley Fair while Lewis is judging the grange displays. If omitted, the NPC will keep their normal festival dialogue.
If this is set without Fair_Judged*, the NPC will keep this dialogue after judging is done.
Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_PurpleShorts
Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_Skipped
Fair_Judged_PlayerLost

Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_Skipped: the player didn't put anything in their display. Defaults to Fair_Judged_PlayerLost if omitted.
Fair_Judged_PlayerLost or Fair_Judged_PlayerWon: the player didn't/did win first place. Defaults to Fair_Judged if omitted.
Fair_Judged: shown if a more specific dialogue didn't match. If omitted, the NPC will keep their current dialogue.
FlowerDance_Accept_Roommate
FlowerDance_Accept_Spouse
FlowerDance_Accept Shown at the Flower Dance when the NPC agrees to dance. The game will prefer the _Roommate (if roommates) or _Spouse (if married) variant if applicable, else it'll check for the normal key. If omitted, defaults to a generic accept dialogue.
FlowerDance_Decline
danceRejection Shown at the Flower Dance when the NPC declines to dance. (A different dialogue is used if they've already agreed to dance with another player.)
danceRejection is a deprecated older name (which still works as a fallback).
WinterStar_GiveGift_Before_Roommate
WinterStar_GiveGift_Before_Spouse
WinterStar_GiveGift_Before
WinterStar_GiveGift_After_Roommate
WinterStar_GiveGift_After_Spouse
WinterStar_GiveGift_After Shown at the Feast of the Winter Star when the NPC gives the player their gift (before and after the player opens it). The game will prefer the _Roommate (if roommates) or _Spouse (if married) variant if applicable, else it'll check for the normal key. If omitted, the before/after dialogues each separately default to a generic translation for all NPCs.
WinterStar_ReceiveGift_<id>
WinterStar_ReceiveGift_<tag>
WinterStar_ReceiveGift Shown at the Feast of the Winter Star when receiving their gift from the player. This can be by item ID (like WinterStar_ReceiveGift_(O)128), context tag (like WinterStar_ReceiveGift_category_fish), or for any item (like WinterStar_ReceiveGift). If omitted, defaults to the generic translation for all NPCs.
Location dialogue
Otherwise the game will choose dialogue in this order.
Variants:
Each key can optionally be prefixed with a season name, like springMountain_47_23.
The game will check variants in this order: <season><key>, and <key>. The variants aren't listed below for simplicity. Unlike daily dialogue, location dialogue is endlessly repeatable as long as the trigger conditions are fulfilled, e.g., Being in the location. They will not remove daily dialogue from an npc's dialogue rotation, but will merely overwrite it when the NPC is in the specified location.
NOTE: An NPC must have gift tastes specified for location dialogue to work, even if their CanSocialize field is set to false.
key format description
<location>_<x>_<y> Dialogue shown in the named location when the NPC is standing at tile position <x>, <y>.
Example: Mountain_47_23: "I come here for the peace and quiet."
<location>_<dayName> Dialogue shown in the named location on the given day of week.
Example: Saloon_Fri: "Business has been really good tonight. I'm pleased."
<location><hearts> Dialogue shown in the named location if you have at least <hearts> hearts with them. The <hearts> will be checked in the order 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 (no other value will be recognised).
Example: Saloon8: "Hi there @. I'm glad to see you! You're always welcome here."
<location> Dialogue shown in the named location.
Example: Saloon: "Now that I'm here I can finally relax and socialize a bit."
Note: Location dialogue will be accessible even if the NPC is only walking through the specified map unlike schedule strings that will only be accessible once the schedule end location is reached.
Generic dialogue
Otherwise the game will choose a dialogue using one of these key formats (in precedence order):
<season>_<key>_inlaw_<spouse>
<season>_<key>
<key>_inlaw_<spouse>
<key>
For each variation above: <season> is a season name (like spring_14); _inlaw_<spouse> matches if the player is married to the named NPC, regardless of whether the speaking NPC is related to the named one (like Sat_inlaw_Abigail); and <key> is one of the formats listed below.
key format description
<dayOfMonth> Dialogue shown on the given day of month in the first year only.
WARNING: this first-year-only behavior is different from other keys and often catches unsuspecting modders!
Example: 10: "Did you watch the game last night?#$b#Or wait, do you even have a TV set...?"
<dayOfMonth>_<firstOrLaterYear> Dialogue shown on the given day of month in the first/later year.
Example: 2_1: "My husband Kent is a soldier, working overseas. That's why he's not here right now.#$b#I know he'll come back safe once his tour is over!!#$e#Need something?"
<dayOfWeek><hearts>_<firstOrLaterYear> Dialogue shown on the given day of week if you have at least <hearts> hearts with them, in the first/later year. The <hearts> will be checked in the order 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 (no other value will be recognised).
Example: Thu2_2: "Well, my Dad is back. Have you met him?#$b#I'm just glad he's okay."
<dayOfWeek><hearts> Dialogue shown on the given day of week if you have at least <hearts> hearts with them. The <hearts> will be checked in the order 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 (no other value will be recognised).
Example: Sun4: "Hey, @.#$e#How's your day going?"
<dayOfWeek>_<firstOrLaterYear> Dialogue shown on the given day of week in the first/later year.
Example: Sat_1: "Dad's coming back soon!#$b#I hope he brings me some toys.$u"
<dayOfWeek> Dialogue shown on the given day of week.
Example: Mon: "Oh, hey. Taking a break from work?"
Specific NPCs
NPC key format description
Gil ComeBackLater
Snoring Gil's dialogue when you haven't completed any new Adventure Quest goals. ComeBackLater will be shown once, and all subsequent dialogues will show Snoring.
Rain dialogue
Characters\Dialogue\rainy.xnb contains one dialogue entry per NPC. There's a roughly 50% chance they'll use this dialogue if a special or location dialogue doesn’t match, it's raining, and you're not married to or divorced from them.
Marriage dialogue
Characters\Dialogue\MarriageDialogue.xnb contains dialogue text for all spouses, and each NPC may optionally have their own dialogue file like Characters\Dialogue\MarriageDialogueAbigail.xnb. When looking up a dialogue key, it will use the one in the NPC's file if it exists, else the one in the generic file, else a default text (usually blank).
Each dialogue entry has a key with one of these formats:
key format description
<season>_<day> Dialogue shown when the day starts, if <season> and <day> match the current date.
Example: fall_1: "The scent is unmistakable... mushroom, rotting leaves, pumpkin. It's fall, alright. Isn't it lovely?"
patio_<spouse> Dialogue shown when the NPC is standing on the patio.
<weather>_Day_<random> Daily dialogue added when the day starts, based on the <weather> (Rainy if it's raining, else Indoor even if they're not indoors) and <random> (a random number between 0 and 4). If the game chooses a <random> value that doesn't have a dialogue, it'll use the default text instead.
Rainy_Night_<random> Daily dialogue in the farmhouse after 6pm when it's raining. <random> is a number between 0–5 inclusively or the NPC name, each of which has an equal chance of being randomly chosen. If the game chooses a <random> value that doesn't have a dialogue, it'll use the default text instead.
Example: Rainy_Night_3: "On nights like this, I like to turn the light down low and just listen...$8"
Indoor_Night_<random> Daily dialogue in the farmhouse after 6pm when it's not raining. <random> is a number between 0–4 inclusively or the NPC name, each of which has an equal chance of being randomly chosen. If the game chooses a <random> value that doesn't have a dialogue, it'll use the default text instead.
funLeave_<spouse> Dialogue used when leaving the farmhouse, typically during a Monday, or a Friday if they have no job. (See below.)
jobLeave_<spouse> Dialogue used when leaving to go to their job. Only used for Maru, Penny, and Harvey.
funReturn_<spouse> Dialogue shown after 1pm when they enter the farmhouse but before reaching their target position, but only on Monday (any NPC) or Friday (if not Maru/Penny/Harvey).
Example: funReturn_Abigail: "Hey! Did you have a good day? Mine went well. It was refreshing to take a walk.$h"
jobReturn_<spouse> Dialogue shown after 1pm when they enter the farmhouse but before reaching their target position, but only if funReturn isn't shown instead.
Example: jobReturn_Penny: "#$c .5#Good evening. My day was fine, thanks! How was yours?$h#$e#Jas and Vincent weren't behaving very well today. I'm still all wound up..."
<season>_<spouse> Dialogue shown at 9+ heart levels with a 5% chance each day.
Example: fall_Abigail: "Do I smell pumpkin on you? Maybe I'm just dreaming...$h"
Outdoor_<spouse> Dialogue shown on the farm with a 20% chance.
Example: Outdoor_Abigail: "I'm just going to hang out here, okay?#$e#There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here. *chuckle*$h"
Outdoor_<random> Dialogue shown on the farm with an 80% chance. <random> is a number 0–4, used to randomly select an entry.
Example: Outdoor_3: "It's pretty cool that we have a cave on our property. It's something I always dreamed about.$h"
spouseRoom_<spouse> Dialogue shown when the NPC is in their room.
Example: spouseRoom_Abigail: "$c .5#I got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning.#$e#I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell."
OneKid_<random> Dialogue shown when standing in the kitchen, if they have one child. <random> is a number 0–4, used to randomly select an entry.
OneKid_1: "I wonder if %kid1 will grow up to be a farmer like you?"
TwoKids_<random> Dialogue shown when standing in the kitchen, if they have two children. <random> is a number 0–4, used to randomly select an entry.
TwoKids_2: "I had a dream that %kid2 will grow up to be a famous monster hunter. I've already been thinking about a little armor set."
<affection>_<random> Dialogue shown inside the farmhouse between 11am and 6pm, or when the day starts if a different dialogue isn't selected. <affection> is randomly Bad or Neutral if they have less than 9 hearts; 50% chance of Good if you have 10+ hearts, and 87.5% chance of Good if you have 11+ hearts; else Neutral <random> is a number 0–9, used to randomly select an entry.
Example: Good_5: "I was just admiring the mermaid's pendant you gave me... I'll proudly wear this to my grave.$l"
Data directory
Engagement dialogue
Similar to the rain dialogue, Data\EngagementDialogue.xnb contains entries in the form of <NPC>0 and <NPC>1, which are used when you are engaged but not yet married to an NPC, or, in the case of a roommate, when they have been invited but have not yet moved in.
Event files
Data\Events\*.xnb contains event scripts, including any dialogue in the event (see Modding:Event data).
Extra dialogue
Data\ExtraDialogue.xnb contains miscellaneous strings, some of which are NPC specific:
key format description
PurchasedItem_* Randomly shown by a non-child town NPC after you sell an edible item to a shop. These keys are hardcoded, and you can't add new keys with a similar pattern.
For keys with a number infix (like PurchasedItem_5_Cooking), the number is selected as such:
If the NPC is marked as rude in their data, they use 3.
Otherwise they randomly choose 1-5.
Town_DumpsterDiveComment_Child
Town_DumpsterDiveComment_Teen
Town_DumpsterDiveComment_Adult
Town_DumpsterDiveComment_Linus Shown when an NPC catches you rummaging through trash cans, depending on the NPC's age. Linus has his own dialogue, but other NPCs don't.
SummitEvent_Dialogue3_<spouse> Shown for your NPC spouse near the start of the perfection cutscene.
Movie theater dialogue
An NPC's reaction to a movie is stored in Data\MoviesReactions.xnb, which is structured far differently from every other dialogue file. See Modding:Movie theater data for more details.
Strings directory
Animation descriptions
Strings\animationDescriptions.xnb contains short bits of dialogue to go with certain schedule points. Not to be confused to Data\animationDescriptions.xnb, which contains the data of animations, rather than the strings for their description.
Characters
Strings\Characters.xnb contains miscellaneous dialogue, some of which is NPC-specific:
key format description
MovieInvite_Spouse_<NPC name> Shown when the NPC accepts a movie ticket when they're married to you. If missing, defaults to a MovieInvite_Invited_* key.
MovieInvite_Invited_<NPC name>
MovieInvite_Invited_<manner>
MovieInvite_Invited_<socialAnxiety>
MovieInvite_Invited_<optimism>
MovieInvite_Invited_<age>
MovieInvite_Invited Shown when the NPC accepts a movie ticket. The NPC will use the first key that exists in the order listed here.
The <manner>, <socialAnxiety>, and <optimism> values are those specified in the NPC's equivalent data fields. The <age> value is one of Child, Teen, or Adult.
Phone_* Shown when calling a shop owner NPC on the telephone. These keys are hardcoded, so new keys with the same pattern will be ignored.
Events
Strings\Events.xnb contains miscellaneous dialogue related to events and festivals, some of which is NPC-specific.
Speech bubbles
Strings\SpeechBubbles.xnb contains dialogue spoken by NPCs through speech bubbles when the player enters a given location. This is distinct from the <location>_Entry field in an NPC's Characters\Dialogue\*.xnb file, which is triggered when the NPC enters a given location.
These keys are hardcoded, so new keys with the same pattern will be ignored.
Strings from CS files
Strings\StringsFromCSFiles.xnb contains miscellaneous strings, such as dialogue that's shared between multiple characters, dialogue for some hardcoded events like marriage, etc.
The file has entries in the form "<key>": "dialogue string", where the key is an arbitrary unique identifier. These must exactly match the key expected by the game, but the keys are just unique identifiers — even though most keys look like <file name>.<line number>, that's just the convention originally used to assign IDs and it has no meaning or effect (nor does it even necessarily match the current file name or line number).
In most situations, if the game is unable to find a string for an NPC to say, it will default to NPC.cs.4061 (English version: "Hi.").
Some other useful NPC-specific strings stored here are as follows:
key format description
<NPC name>_AfterWedding Shown after marrying an NPC, when you talk to them on the farm on the same day.
<NPC name>_Engaged
<NPC name>_EngagedRoommate Shown after the NPC accepts an engagement item (e.g. mermaid's pendant or void ghost pendant for vanilla NPCs).
Algorithm
The game finds dialogue as follows:
Event dialogue is read from the appropriate event commands (see Modding:Event data).
Location-specific dialogue is read from StringsFromCSFiles <location>.cs.
Else character dialogue is read from the character-specific files.
If no dialogues were found, the game resorts to hardcoded dialogue from the StringsFromCSFiles files (specifically keys prefixed with NPC.cs NPC.cs).
Format
Dialogue text can contain tokens and commands which control the dialogue box, change the text (e.g., switch between gender-specific strings), inject values, etc. These are parsed by the Dialogue class.
Gender switch
syntax description
${male^female}$
${male^female^non-binary}$ Change text depending on the player's gender. The non-binary value is only used if a mod overrides the player's gender, since the in-game UI only allows male or female.
This is applied before most other commands or parsing, so it can safely be used in cases where ^ might have a different meaning (e.g. mail text). You can also use ¦ instead of ^, in which case any ^ characters are left as-is.
Example: Ahoy there ${lad^lass}$!
Special tokens
character description
# Separates two commands in a dialogue string.
{ TODO. Stands for "breakSpecialCharacter".
% Turns the dialogue box into a generic text box.
Example: "%Abigail is lost in her music."
* Stands for "quickResponseDelineator". Converted in code to #$b#. Use in $y (dialogueQuickReponse) to achieve the effects of #$b#. You can use double asterisks ** to escape a literal asterisk.
^ (Deprecated) Most code should use the newer ${...} form above, which is supported in more places.
Gender switch character. The text before it is shown for male farmers, the text after it for female farmers.
Example: Oh, good morning Mr. @!^Oh, good morning Ms. @!
Portrait commands
These set the portrait shown in the dialogue box for the current line of dialogue. If there's no portrait command, the neutral portrait is used.
Portraits are numbered left-to-right and top-to-bottom, starting at $0. The first six portraits are standard, and can be identified by the number (like $2) or a unique alias (like $s). All potential spouses and many other characters have these six portraits, but it's not fully consistent; for example, Caroline only has four.
numbered alias description
$0 Use their neutral portrait.
$1 $h Use their happy portrait.
$2 $s Use their sad portrait.
$3 $u Use their unique portrait. This is different for each NPC: grumpy (Abigail), holding football (Alex), angry (Caroline), sick (Governor), etc.
$4 $l Use their love portrait.
$5 $a Use their angry portrait.
$<id> A custom portrait beyond the standard six.
Portrait commands should be at the end of a dialogue line:
"fall_Fri6": "When I was a little girl, my father abandoned us.$s#$b#I'm sorry to make things uncomfortable for you...$u#$e#Anyway... How's the farming life going?",
Dialogue commands
command description
$action <action> Run a trigger action string, like $action AddMoney 500 to add 500g to the current player.
$b Indicates pauses in dialogue, where the player will need to click for the next part to load in a new dialogue box.
$c <probability>#<text1>#<text2> Show <text1> with a <probability> between 0 and 1; otherwise, show <text2>. E.g. $c 0.9 for a 90% chance of <text1> and a 10% chance of <text2>. NOTE: Replacer commands (see below) do not work in <text1>. This does not need to be the first command in a dialogue string. It is unaffected by daily luck.
$d <state id>#<text1>|<text2> Show one of two dialogue strings based on a predefined condition: bus (whether the bus is repaired), joja (whether the Joja Mart is still in business), cc or communitycenter (whether the Community Center is accessible), or kent (whether Kent has returned to the valley). The dialogue string must start with $d, everything up to the first | symbol is shown if the condition matches, and everything after that is shown if the condition doesn't match.
For example:
"Mon2": "$d kent#Yesterday I visited Yoba's Altar to give thanks for my husband's safe return.|Yesterday I visited Yoba's Altar to ask for my husband's safe return.#$e#I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard sometimes.$s"
$e Ends the current dialogue, closing the dialogue box and resuming player control. The dialogue following $e will require a new interaction with the NPC.
$k Short for dialogueKill. Removes all dialogue messages after the current one.
$p <response ID>#<match text>|<no-match text> Stands for "dialoguePrerequisite". Shows different text depending on whether the player gave a particular answer to a previously-asked question. If <response ID> matches an answer the player gave, <match text> is shown; otherwise, <no-match text> is shown. These texts are separated by | and only <no-match text> can contain additional commands. This does not need to be the first command in the dialogue string.
You can check multiple response IDs. For example, this will show the first dialogue if the player chose dialogue answer 17, 18, or Apple:
$p 17|18|Apple#I guess you think nothing would happen, right?$u|Maybe a wicked ghost would appear!
$q <response IDs> <fallback>#<text> Show a dialogue box containing the given question text. If <response IDs> (a list delimited by /) contains an answer already given, the question is skipped (along with the rest of this dialogue line), and instead the dialogue entry identified by <fallback> will be appended to whatever precedes this $q command. The <fallback> dialogue typically uses a $p command to adjust the text based on the player's answer to this question. NOTE: dialogue questions must use unique IDs, similar to events. See the event data page for more information.
$query <query>#<if true>|<if false> Show different dialogue text depending on the game state query in <query>. For example:
"Mon": "$query !PLAYER_VISITED_LOCATION Current Mine#Did you know there's an old abandoned mine up in the mountain? Apparently it's crawling with monsters!|I heard you went into the old mines up in the mountain!#Did you find anything tasty?$h"
$r <response ID> <friendship> <reaction> [observerfriendship]#<answer text> Define a response option to a $q question dialogue. <answer text> is the text shown. <response ID> is used to group responses for future reference (multiple answers can share an answer ID). <friendship> defines the change in friendship value with the speaker, positive or negative, if this response is selected. <reaction> names the dialogue entry from the NPC's Content\Characters\Dialogue\*.xnb file that will be the NPC's reaction if this response is selected by the player. [observerfriendship] is an underscore (_) separated string which, if included, affects the friendship with another NPC if this response is selected. It takes the format of friend_NPCID_Integer, e.g. "friend_George_-20" or "friend_Penny_40".
$t <topic ID> [day length] Add a conversation topic for the next [day length] days (default 4 days).
$v <event id> [check preconditions] [skip if seen] Immediately start an event and end the current dialogue, subject to the conditions:
[check preconditions]: whether to ignore the command if the event's preconditions don't match (one of true or false). Default true.
[skip if seen]: whether to ignore the command if the player has already seen the given event. Default true.
If the event is not played, the dialogue continues to the next line instead.
For example, $v 60367 false false will replay the bus arrival event from the start of the game. $v SomeMod.Test true false#$b#Wow! Good timing!$1 will play the event "SomeMod.Test" if the player meets the precondition requirements. If they do not, the dialogue "Wow! Good timing!$1" will play instead.
Note: The command will only work if it is at the very start of the dialogue. Adding any dialogue or other commands before it will cause it not to trigger the event and display the event commands as dialogue instead.
$y '<answer>_<reply>' Stands for "dialogueQuickResponse"; A simpler form of question. Works like $q, but within one and the same text line. It doesn't have response IDs that can be used with "dialoguePrerequisite" ($p). It can't be used for friendship point changes. It can be triggered indefinitely. It doesn't have to be the first command in a dialogue string as long as the dialogue before it ends with #$e# or #$b#. It can have more than two answer/reply pairs.
Example: Penny: "$y 'Breakfast?_Yes please._Here you go._No, I'm good_More for me then!'"
$1 <letter ID>#<1st-time text> #$e# <nth-time text> Creates a line of dialogue which the character will only see once (at most). <1st-time text> is shown only if <letter ID> has not been marked as sent yet (and this marks it as sent); otherwise, <nth-time text> is shown. <letter ID> should not correspond to an actual piece of mail (because it will not be sent), but it can be referenced by events or other dialogue lines.
%fork Sets the the specialEventVariable1 variable, which can be checked by a later fork event command. Mainly useful in reaction dialogue for $q questions during events.
%revealtaste:<NPC name>:<item ID>
%revealtaste<NPC><object ID> Reveals the named character's gift taste for an object in their social menu profile. For example, %revealtaste:Lewis:(O)258 will update Lewis's profile to show that he likes blueberries. This only works if it's in the first message in a dialogue box (i.e., before any #$b# break, though #$e# breaks are fine).
The second form is deprecated and only works with unqualified numeric item IDs.
[<id>+] Gives the player a random item, from the pool of item IDs within the brackets. For example,
"I spent the afternoon daydreaming about the ocean. So I decided to cook some seafood. [(O)198 (O)202 (O)727 (O)MossSoup]$h"
...gives one of 198 (Baked Fish), 202 (Fried Calamari), 727 (Chowder), or MossSoup (Moss Soup) as a gift.
Each one can be a qualified or unqualified item ID.
Question example
To understand how $q, $r, and $p work, an example may be helpful. Note how you can format the script to be easier to read:
summer_Fri:
    "I think I'll go to the beach tomorrow!
    #$q 305/306 beachquestion_followup#Would you like to go with me?
        #$r 305 15 beachquestion_yes#Sure, I would love to!
        #$r 306 0 beachquestion_sorry#Oh, sorry, I've already made plans with someone else...
        #$r 306 -10 beachquestion_no#No thank you.
    ",
    "beachquestion_yes": "Good! It's a date.$h",
    "beachquestion_sorry": "Oh. Darn. Okay.$6",
    "beachquestion_no": "Oh. Um. Sorry.$s",
    "beachquestion_followup":
        "$p 305
            #Tomorrow should be a lot of fun!$h
            |Hmm, I wonder if I can get someone to go with me...$s
        ",

summer_Sat:
    "The beach is lovely this time of year...
    #$p 305
        #Thanks for coming with me today.$h
        |Oh, hi @, how's it going?
    ",
The dialogue above triggers on any Friday in the summer. The NPC begins with a response that is always shown: "I think I'll go to the beach tomorrow!"
Next they ask you a question.
#$q 305/306 beachquestion_followup#Would you like to go with me?
$q starts the question. 305/306 checks to see if this question has been asked before, and if it has it sends you to the dialogue key beachquestion_followup. (Note that you can name your dialogue keys whatever you like which makes it easier to read.)
Next are the responses the player can give. You can add any number of $r lines; here we have three:
    #$r 305 15 beachquestion_yes#Sure, I would love to!
    #$r 306 0 beachquestion_sorry#Oh, sorry, I've already made plans with someone else...
    #$r 306 -10 beachquestion_no#No thank you.
If you say yes (first option), the game will store ID 305 as the answer given to this question. Next, your friendship with that person increases by 15. beachquestion_yes tells the script which dialogue key continuation to use as a response to your answer.
If you say no (second and third option) the game will store ID 306 as the answer given, then depending on which answer you gave will either not change your friendship with the person, 0, or reduce it, -10. Then it will use either beachquestion_sorry or beachquestion_no to continue the dialogue.
Now we need to make dialogue keys for each response:
    beachquestion_yes: "Good! It's a date.$h",
    beachquestion_sorry: "Oh. Darn. Okay.$6",
    beachquestion_no: "Oh. Um. Sorry.$s",
    beachquestion_followup:
        "$p 305
            #Tomorrow should be a lot of fun!$h
            |Hmm, I wonder if I can get someone to go with me...$s
        ",
Of note here is beachquestion_followup. If the player talks to the NPC again, $q 305/306 will check that the question has already been answered and instead go directly to this key.
$p 305 begins a variable response which means "if the player chose yes, say this line, else say this line instead". If the player answered yes, the NPC responds happily. Otherwise, they will comment that they need to find someone to go with them.
There is another variable response the next day:
summer_Sat:
    "The beach is lovely this time of year...
    #$p 305
        #Thanks for coming with me today.$h
        |Oh, hi @, how's it going?
    ",
Once again the first line (The beach is lovely...) always shows up when the player talks to the NPC, but the next line depends on whether or not they've answered yes the previous day.
Here is another example from Haley's existing dialogue file. Note how the script formatting is harder to read, but the game is able to process both.
    summer_Sat: "Farming sounds so boring...#$q 42/43 summer_Sat_old#What do you even do all day?#$r 42 10 summer_Sat_12#Care for plants#$r 42 10 summer_Sat_12#Explore the caves#$r 43 -10 summer_Sat_13#Snoop around in your room#$r 42 10 summer_Sat_12#Dig for treasure" #!String
    summer_Sat_old: "#$p 43#Hey, you better not be snooping around in my room anymore!$a|But I guess it could get you in pretty good shape." #!String
    summer_Sat_12: "Hmm... sounds like a lot of work." #!String
    summer_Sat_13: "What? You'd better not be doing that!$a" #!String
The first time the summer_Sat dialogue is chosen, neither response 42 nor 43 will have been given (because this question is the only one which has them as responses), so Haley will say, "Farming sounds so boring... What do you even do all day?" The player can select among these responses:
Care for plants
Explore the caves
Snoop around in your room
Dig for treasure
The third response, $r 43 -10 summer_Sat_13#Snoop around in your room, sets response ID 43, reduces Haley's friendship by 10 points, and brings up the dialogue summer_Sat_13 (Haley says, "What? You'd better not be doing that!"). All of the other responses set response ID 42, increase Haley's friendship by 10 points, and bring up the dialogue summer_Sat_12 ("Hmm... sounds like a lot of work.").
The next time summer_Sat is chosen, one of the response IDs listed in the $q command will have been given (either 42 or 43). Therefore, the $q and everything after is scrapped, and dialogue summer_Sat_old is put in its place. This new dialogue uses the $p command to change Haley's dialogue based on whether or not you gave response ID 43 to any previous question. If you answered "Snoop around your room," everything before the | will be used, so Haley will now say, "Farming sounds so boring... Hey, you better not be snooping around in my room anymore!" If response ID 43 has not been given (in this case, you must have given response ID 42, i.e., one of the other three responses to the previous question), everything after the | will be used, so Haley will instead say, "Farming sounds so boring... But I guess it could get you in pretty good shape."
Replacer commands
Replacer commands will be replaced with the relevant string. Note that in mail entries, only the @ replacer works.
command description
@ Farmer's name.
Example: Hi there @!
%adj Random adjective. (Defined in StringsFromCSFiles.xnb)
%noun Random noun. (Defined in StringsFromCSFiles.xnb)
%place Random place name. (Defined in StringsFromCSFiles.xnb)
%spouse The name of Farmer's spouse.
%name A randomly-generated name.
%firstnameletter The first half of the farmer's name (rounded down), like Nat if the farmer's name is Natalie.
%time Current time.
%band The name of Sam and Sebastian's band.
%book The title of Elliott's book.
%pet The name of Farmer's pet.
%farm Farm name.
%favorite The Farmer's favorite thing.
%kid1 The name of Farmer's first child.

Values
The game uses these predefined values in some dialogue keys. This section is linked from above where needed.
Days of week
Mon
Tue
Wed
Thu
Fri
Sat
Sun
Seasons
spring
summer
fall
winter
First/later year
In some cases the game uses a "first/later year" value for dialogue conditions. This only has two possible values:
value meaning
1 Occurs in the first year.
2 Occurs in any year after the first (not only year 2).
Response IDs
A response ID identifies an answer chosen by the player in response to a question dialogue. In some cases a question may have several answers with the same ID (e.g., several variations of "yes"), or use the same ID for every question (in which case the ID just shows whether the player has answered the question).
Mods can add their own response IDs, but here are the vanilla IDs as of 1.3.36¹:

Conversation topics
A conversation topic is a temporary flag which can be checked in event preconditions and game state queries and can trigger one-time NPC dialogue (if they have a matching dialogue key). They're stored in Farmer.activeDialogueEvents while active, and are moved from there into Farmer.previousActiveDialogueEvents once they expire.
Since they are temporary, they are very useful for scheduling delays between events: for example, once a topic is added, you can have a subsequent event precondition only satisfied if the topic is not active, so the topic's duration in days must elapse before the event can be viewed.
A conversation topic can be started in a number of ways:
using the addConversationTopic event command
using the AddConversationTopic trigger action
using the $t dialogue command
using the %item conversationTopic mail command
in code by calling Farmer.activeDialogueEvents.TryAdd(string, int)
A conversation topic lasts four days by default. All methods listed above can optionally specify a preferred duration instead.
Topic memory
In addition to the normal active time, the game also keeps track of how long ago topics were set and automatically generates additional topics after a certain number of days. These topics always use the original key and append _memory_<time> to it (please note: the game checks for keys to contain the string "_memory_" to control its behavior here, so you should avoid using that string in your topic IDs if possible).
Here are the keys and how long they take to appear. All of them last for four days.
id days since original key
<key>_memory_oneday 1
<key>_memory_oneweek 7
<key>_memory_twoweeks 14
<key>_memory_fourweeks 28
<key>_memory_eightweeks 56
<key>_memory_oneyear 104
Note that the _memory_oneyear key entry is not a typo, and starts after 104 days, which is slightly less than one full year (112 days).
Generic topics
These topics are generated by the game in response to the player fulfilling certain conditions. These topics automatically cover any mods that add data alongside vanilla, so (for example) any mod-added events will generate eventSeen_ topics, any NPCs will generate married_ when the player marries them, etc. Combined with topic memory, this gives you a lot of power to time events and coordinate NPC behavior without having to do any extra work.
All of these topics last for four days.
id trigger

Dialogue class
A sequence of NPC dialogues is represented by a Dialogue instance. Some useful fields/methods include:
member usage
dialogues The 'dialogue lines' to display. Each entry is shown in a single dialogue box (but isn't necessarily a single line or sentence).
Each dialogue line can have text to show, a side effect (i.e. code to run when it's displayed), or both. If an entry has a side-effect, it's applied as soon as that dialogue entry is shown in the dialogue box. If the entry has no text, the game skips to the next entry in the list (if any) after applying the side-effect.
speaker The NPC instance speaking the dialogue line, if applicable.
CurrentEmotion The portrait command for the current dialogue line.
TranslationKey The translation key from which the current dialogue line was taken, if applicable.
getCurrentDialogue() Get the formatted dialogue text currently being displayed.
getPortraitIndex() The index from the NPC's portraits spritesheet to display for the current dialogue line.
isOnFinalDialogue() Whether the dialogue is currently showing last dialogue line which has text to display.
isDialogueFinished() Whether all dialogue lines have been shown.
convertToDwarvish() Replace the current dialogue line with the Dwarvish translation (as spoken by Dwarf when the player doesn't have the dwarvish translation guide).
The Dialogue class also provides a number of static methods for working with dialogues. Some of the main ones include:
method usage
TryGetDialogue(…) Create a dialogue for a given NPC and translation key, or return null if the translation key isn't found.
This is commonly used to implement fallback dialogues. For example:
Dialogue? dialogue =
    Dialogue.TryGetDialogue(npc, $"Charaxters\\Dialogue\\{npc.Name}:SomeKey_{relationship}")
    ?? Dialogue.TryGetDialogue(npc, "Charaxters\\Dialogue\\{npc.Name}:SomeKey");
Note that this is somewhat low-level. In most cases, you should use the equivalent NPC.TryGetDialogue method which reads from the NPC's dialogue file. For example:
Dialogue? dialogue =
    npc.TryGetDialogue($"SomeKey_{relationship}")
    ?? npc.TryGetDialogue("SomeKey");
FromTranslation(…) Create a dialogue for a given NPC and translation key. This is similar to TryGetDialogue, but an invalid dialogue key is shown as-is instead.
GetFallbackForError() Get a fallback dialogue to show when an error happens and a suitable dialogue can't be loaded. This is some variation of "..." depending on the language.
applyGenderSwitchBlocks(…) Process gender switch blocks in a given text. This works with any text by design, not just dialogue text. You can either use the current player's gender, or specify a gender to use.
For example:
string text = Dialogue.applyGenderSwitchBlocks("Hello ${lad^lass}$!"); // results in "Hello lad!" or "Hello lass!"
convertToDwarvish(text) Get the Dwarvish translation for a given dialogue line (as spoken by Dwarf when the player doesn't have the dwarvish translation guide).
DialogueBox class
DialogueBox is the menu shown in-game when a message box is displayed. This is usually an NPC dialogue, but it's also used for some non-NPC messages.
Some useful fields include:
field usage
characterDialogue If this is a standard NPC dialogue, the Dialogue instance being shown.
dialogues If this is a custom dialogue, the dialogue lines being shown.
isPortraitBox() Whether the dialogue box has an NPC portrait.
For NPC dialogues, you can use the MenuChanged event to detect when a specific dialogue is shown. For example:
private void OnMenuChanged(object sender, MenuChangedEventArgs e)
{
    bool isAbigailDanceRejection =
        e.NewMenu is DialogueBox dialogueBox
        && dialogueBox.characterDialogue is {} dialogue
        && dialogue.speaker?.Name == "Abigail"
        && dialogue.TranslationKey == "Characters\\Dialogue\\Abigail:danceRejection";
}
