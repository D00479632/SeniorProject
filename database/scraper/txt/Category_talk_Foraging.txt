island forage
I am not clear at why Magma Cap and Ginger don't belong to "Island Forage" Category. ðŸ¤” It might be better to create the new Category and let them join it.

Add this category to the Items category?
Hi. I've noticed that most of the things listed in here are either pages about individual items, or subcategories containing pages about individual items. Also, it isn't unheard of in this wiki to have pages in multiple categories at once. The Craftable items category, for example, is located in both the Crafting and Items categories. Therefore, it makes sense to me to likewise place this category in the Items category, in addition to the Skills category. Any thoughts on this? Cheese80 (talk) 19:00, 14 February 2025 (UTC)
