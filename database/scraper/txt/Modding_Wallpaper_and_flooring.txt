Overview
Wallpaper and flooring (or floorpaper) are items which can be applied to a decoratable location like a farmhouse or shed to visually change its floor or wall design. These are separate from placeable flooring items like brick floor.
They have item types (WP) and (FL) respectively (or ItemRegistry.type_wallpaper and ItemRegistry.type_floorpaper in C# code); their data in Data/AdditionalWallpaperFlooring; their icon sprites in Maps/walls_and_floors, Maps/floors_2, or Maps/wallpapers_2 by default; and their code in StardewValley.Objects.Wallpaper.
Data format
The wallpaper and flooring data in Data/AdditionalWallpaperFlooring consists of a list of models, where each value is a model with the fields listed below.
field description
ID A unique ID value. This is not shown in-game.
Texture The asset name which contains 32x32 pixel (flooring) or 16x48 pixel (wallpaper) sprites. The tilesheet must be 256 pixels wide, but can have any number of flooring/wallpaper rows.
IsFlooring Whether this is a flooring tilesheet; else it's a wallpaper tilesheet.
Count The number of flooring or wallpaper sprites in the tilesheet.
Example
For example, this Content Patcher pack would add three new wallpapers to the game:
{
    "Format": "2.5.0",
    "Changes": [
        // define wallpaper
        {
            "Action": "EditData",
            "Target": "Data/AdditionalWallpaperFlooring",
            "Entries": {
                "{{ModId}}_ExampleWallpapers": { // for technical reasons, you need to specify the ID here *and* in the "ID" field
                    "ID": "{{ModId}}_ExampleWallpapers",
                    "Texture": "Mods/{{ModId}}/Wallpapers",
                    "IsFlooring": false,
                    "Count": 3
                }
            }
        },

        // load wallpaper tilesheet
        {
            "Action": "Load",
            "Target": "Mods/{{ModId}}/Wallpapers",
            "FromFile": "assets/wallpapers.png"
        }
    ]
}
