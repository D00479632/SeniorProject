History section
Hello! When adding new 1.6 content to pages, please try to add a "History" section to the pages. This is so people know what changed with the page with the new update. The Strawberry Seeds page has a good format for the History section for Desert Festival obtainability. If you have time, add this to all of the pages. Thank you!

I greatly appreciate this feedback. Going to work back through my contributions to add the information you suggested. Any advice in terms of when or when not to add hyperlinks within the history section? Ollie (talk) 23:56, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
