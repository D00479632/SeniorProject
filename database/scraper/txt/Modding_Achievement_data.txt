This page explains how the game stores and parses achievement data. This is an advanced guide for mod developers.
Raw data
Achievement data is stored in Content\Data\Achievements.xnb, which can be unpacked for editing. Here's the raw data as of 1.6 for reference:

Index Field Example Value
0 name Moving Up
1 description Upgrade your house.
2 display achievement on collections tab before it's earned true
3 prerequisite achievement -1
4 hat earned (index from hats.xnb) 13
If index 2 is "true" and index 3 is "-1" then the achievement star will be displayed on the collections tab (greyed out if not yet achieved). Otherwise, index 3 shows the number of the achievement that must be earned before the achievement will be displayed on the Collections tab. (Example: you must earn achievement 28 "Treasure Trove" before achievement 5 "A Complete Collection" will be displayed.)
The only achievement with a value of "false" in index 2 is the secret achievement that doesn't display until it's earned.
For a list of hats, see hat data.
