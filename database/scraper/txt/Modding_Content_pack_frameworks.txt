Content pack frameworks are SMAPI mods designed to simplify the process of creating content packs for Stardew Valley. While they aim to minimize the need for programming experience, some familiarity with coding concepts can be helpful. Creating mods directly in C# for SMAPI may offer insight into the way the game works. Content packs are one of the two main ways to mod Stardew Valley, alongside creating C# mods for SMAPI directly.
Here's a list of software for pixel art and JSON text editors we recommend. With software like VS Code and Sublime, you can set up the schema so it checks the formatting of your JSON file as you write your mod. In that way, it's like a built in json validator site. More details on setting up the schema here.

Content Patcher
The recommended framework mod to use is Content Patcher, which allows you to change how Stardew Valley loads its contents, assets, sprites, maps, and even much of its logic from its Content folder.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of new things you can add to the game using Content Patcher:
Items (including cooking, crops, trees, clothing, furniture, and new artisan machines that can process inputs)
Buildings, maps, and locations
Farm animals and pets
NPCs, including dialogue, sprites, schedule and events
Mail, shops, quests, and special orders
With Content Patcher you can also patch existing assets, which includes:
Retexturing sprites, including (but not limited to) item sprites, NPC portraits and map appearance
Changing NPC behavior, dialogue or even their name
Modify maps to add new locations or warps
See Modding:Content Patcher for a getting started guide.
Other popular frameworks
While you want to use Content Patcher in most cases, other frameworks can be useful if you need features that isn't supported by the game engine itself. These framework mods usually either extend Content Patcher by adding new assets to the game for content packs to edit (in which case they don't have their own content pack formats, but instead rely on Content Patcher's own), or define their own separate formats.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of framework mods used most often to create content packs. (The parenthesis next to each name is the conventional acronym used in the folder name for mods that do not use Content Patcher.).
Core (1000+ content packs)
mod is CP extension functionality
Json Assets (JA) no Create specific item types, with support for functionality specific to each item type (e.g., specifying crafting/cooking/recipes or gift tastes for new items). It currently supports creating objects, big craftables, crops, fruit trees, hats, weapons, shirts, pants, and boots. Content and images added by Json Assets can also be edited through Content Patcher.
See its GitHub readme for documentation.
Note: 1.6 adds the ability to add new items natively via CP, which should be the preferred method.
Alternative Textures (AT) no Enables texture variation for placeable objects, buildings and entities. This includes trees, animals, pets, farm buildings, plants, and more.
Popular (400+)
mod is CP extension functionality
Producer Framework Mod (PFM) no Add/change the inputs/outputs/behaviour of any machine in the game. That includes vanilla machines (e.g., keg), machines added by other mods, and adding machine logic to any big craftable.
Note: 1.6 adds the ability to add new machine rules natively via CP, which should be the preferred method. PFM still provides several additional features not found in the base game (though most of them are covered by Extra Machine Config, an addon framework on top of CP).

Mail Framework Mod (MFM) no Add new mail with functionality like custom backgrounds, repeating mail, a wider variety of mail attachments, and support for multiple attachments.
