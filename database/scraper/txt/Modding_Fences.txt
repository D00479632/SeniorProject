This page documents how the game stores and parses fence data. This is an advanced guide for mod developers.
Data format
You can add or customize fences by editing the Data/Fences asset.
This consists of a string → model lookup, where the key is the unqualified item ID of the fence object, and the value is a model with these fields:
field effect
Health The health points for a fence when it's first placed, which affects how quickly it degrades. A fence loses 1/1440 points per in-game minute (roughly 0.04 points per hour or 0.5 points for a 12-hour day).
Repairing a fence sets its max health to 2 × (base_health + repair_health_adjustment), where base_health is this field's value and repair_health_adjustment is a random value between RepairHealthAdjustmentMinimum and RepairHealthAdjustmentMaximum.
Texture The asset name for the texture (under the game's Content folder) when the fence is placed. Use \ (or \\ in JSON) to separate name segments if needed. For example, the vanilla fences use individual tilesheets like LooseSprites\Fence1 (wood fence).
RemovalToolIds
RemovalToolTypes A list of tool IDs (matching the keys in Data\ToolData) or C# full type names which can be used to break the fence.
For example, this will let the player break the fence with an iridium axe and any pickaxe:
"RemovalToolIds": ["IridiumAxe"],
"RemovalToolTypes": ["StardewValley.Tools.Pickaxe"]
A tool must match RemovalToolIds or RemovalToolTypes to be a valid removal tool. If both lists are null or empty, all tools can remove the fence.
PlacementSound The audio cue ID played when the fence is placed or repaired (e.g. axe used by Wood Fence).
RemovalSound (Optional) The audio cue ID played when the fence is broken or picked up by the player. Defaults to the same sound as PlacementSound.
RemovalDebrisType (Optional) The type of cosmetic debris particles to 'splash' from the tile when the fence is broken with a tool. The defined values are 0 (copper), 2 (iron), 4 (coal), 6 (gold), 8 (coins), 10 (iridium), 12 (wood), 14 (stone), 32 (big stone), and 34 (big wood). Default 14 (stone).
RepairHealthAdjustmentMinimum
RepairHealthAdjustmentMaximum (Optional) A random amount added to the Health when a fence is repaired by a player. See the Health field description. Both default to 0.
HeldObjectDrawOffset (Optional) When an item like a torch is placed on the fence, the pixel offset to apply to its draw position. Specified as a string in the form "<x>, <y>". Defaults to "0, -20" if omitted.
LeftEndHeldObjectDrawX
RightEndHeldObjectDrawX (Optional) The X pixel offset to apply when the fence is oriented horizontally, with only one connected fence on the right (for LeftEndHeldObjectDrawX) or left (for RightEndHeldObjectDrawX). This fully replaces the X value specified by HeldObjectDrawOffset when it's applied. Default 0.
