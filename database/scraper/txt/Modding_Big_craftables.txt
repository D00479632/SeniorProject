Overview
Big craftables are items which can be placed in the world and are two tiles tall (instead of one like objects). Unlike objects, they can't be eaten or sold to most shops.
They have item type (BC) (or ItemRegistry.type_bigCraftable in C# code), their data in Data/BigCraftables, their in-game sprites in TileSheets/Craftables by default, and their code in StardewValley.Object (based on the bigCraftable field).
Data format
The big craftable data in Data/BigCraftables consists of a string → model lookup, where...
The key is the unqualified item ID.
The value is a model with the fields listed below.
