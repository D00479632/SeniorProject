Re: Adding sub-page links
Could we add links to sub-pages on here? Like adding the pages for the different item types as an indented list under the link to the Items page? I had to search the Modding namespace for "Modding::Furniture" today because I remembered there being information about furniture somewhere on the wiki but couldn't find a link to it and didn't realise it was linked in the Item types table on the Items page. It's not the first time I've come across "ghost" pages or had to go digging to find a page I knew about for someone else, either. --Abagaianye (talk) 15:21, 12 February 2025 (UTC)
