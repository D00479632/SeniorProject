Overview
Boots are items which can be equipped in the player's boots slot. These change the player sprite and may provide buffs.
They have item type (B) (or ItemRegistry.type_boots in C# code), their data in Data/Boots, their sprites in Maps/springobjects (item) and Characters/Farmer/shoeColors (shoe color) by default, and their code in StardewValley.Objects.Boots.
Data format
The boots data in Data/Boots consists of a string → string dictionary, where...
The key is the unqualified item ID.
The value is a slash-delimited string with the fields listed below.

            "Action": "Load",
            "Target": "{{ModId}}/Boots, {{ModId}}/BootsColor",
            "FromFile": "assets/{{TargetWithoutPath}}.png" // `assets/Boots.png` and `assets/BootsColor.png`
        },

        // add data
        {
