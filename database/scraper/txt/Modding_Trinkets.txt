This page explains how the game stores and parses trinket-type item data. For items in general, see Modding:Items.
Overview
Trinkets are items that can be equipped in the player's trinket slot to enable special effects.
They have item type (TR) (or ItemRegistry.type_trinket in C# code), their data in Data/Trinkets, their vanilla icon sprites in TileSheets\Objects_2, and their code in StardewValley.Objects.Trinkets.Trinket.
Data format
The trinket data in Data/Trinkets consists of a string → model lookup, where...
The key is the unqualified item ID and internal name.
The value is a model with the fields listed below.
field purpose
Id A unique string ID for this entry. This should match the entry key.
The following describes the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.6.15, and may change before release.
This field will be removed in 1.6.15.
DisplayName
Description A tokenizable string for the item's in-game display name and description.
Texture The asset name for the texture containing the item's sprite.
SheetIndex The sprite's index within the Texture, where 0 is the top-left sprite.
TrinketEffectClass The C# TrinketEffect subclass which implements the trinket behavior. This can safely be a mod class, since it's not written to the save file.
This should be the full assembly-qualified name in the form namespace.class, assembly. For example: StardewValley.Objects.Trinkets.CompanionTrinketEffect, StardewValley.
DropsNaturally (Optional) Whether this trinket can be spawned randomly (e.g. in mine treasure chests). Default true.
CanBeReforged (Optional) Whether players can re-roll this trinket's stats using an anvil. This assumes that the TrinketEffectClass implements the GenerateRandomStats method. Default true.
CustomFields (Optional) The custom fields for this entry.
ModData (Optional) The mod data fields to add to created trinket instances. Default none.
For example:
"ModData": {
    "Example.ModId_FieldName": "some custom data"
}
