SMAPI
Possible breaking changes
Notable changes which may break SMAPI mods:
Various method signatures have changed, notably Item.canStackWith. In most cases just recompiling will fix those. (Don't forget to update the manifest.json version!)
Location lookups (e.g., using Game1.getLocationFromName) are now cached to improve performance. When removing or replacing a location, make sure to remove it from the cache too using Game1.removeLocationFromLocationLookup.
Some notable field/method changes:
class field/method changes
Farm shippingBin This field no longer exists. Use farm.getShippingBin(Game1.player) instead, which will return the global or personal shipping bin depending on the host settings.
Farm shipItem(Item item) Removed; add directly to farm.getShippingBin(Game1.player) instead.
Farmer money Replaced by Money, which handles shared/individual wallets for you.
Game1 itemsToShip Removed; see farm.getShippingBin(Game1.player) or Game1.player.displayedShippedItems instead.
Game1 getCharacterFromName(string name, bool mustBeVillager) The default for mustBeVillager changed from false to true, and added an overload to get a specific NPC type like Game1.getCharacterFromName<Pet>("petName", mustBeVillager: false).
Game1 dailyLuck Use Game1.player.DailyLuck or Game1.player.team.sharedDailyLuck as appropriate instead.
Item getStack No longer exists; use Item.Stack instead.
Item addToStack Now takes an Item reference instead of stack count, but otherwise equivalent (i.e., it returns the remaining stack count but doesn't change the item passed in).
Pet wasPetToday Replaced by lastPetDay, which is the Game1.Date.TotalDays value when it was last pet by each player. To check if any player pet them today:
private bool WasPetToday(Pet pet)
{
    NetLongDictionary<int, NetInt> lastPettedDays = ModEntry.ReflectionHelper.GetField<NetLongDictionary<int, NetInt>>(pet, "lastPetDay").GetValue();
    return lastPettedDays.Values.Any(day => day == Game1.Date.TotalDays);
}
To check if the current player pet them today:
private bool WasPetTodayByCurrentPlayer(Pet pet)
{
    NetLongDictionary<int, NetInt> lastPettedDays = ModEntry.ReflectionHelper.GetField<NetLongDictionary<int, NetInt>>(pet, "lastPetDay").GetValue();
    return lastPettedDays.TryGetValue(Game1.player.UniqueMultiplayerID, out int lastDay) && lastDay == Game1.Date.TotalDays;
}
ShopMenu itemPriceAndStock Changed from Dictionary<Item, int[]> to Dictionary<ISalable, int[]>, but otherwise equivalent. (Item implements ISalable.)
ShopMenu forSale Changed from List<Item> to List<ISalable>, but otherwise equivalent. (Item implements ISalable.)
Mods previously checked if the current tool was a scythe with code like this:
bool isScythe = tool.InitialParentTileIndex == MeleeWeapon.scythe;
That's no longer reliable since there are two scythe items. Instead you can do this:
bool isScythe = (tool as MeleeWeapon)?.isScythe() == true;
Other notable changes
These are changes which might be of interest to modders, but shouldn't break any mods.
See Modding wishlist#Done in Stardew Valley 1.4.
Added object context tags.
Paddy crops are a new type which gets a 25% growth bonus for being planted near water, including the new vanilla rice. (Currently Harmony is needed to flag a crop as a paddy crop.)
Added a GameLocation method to patch the location's map from another map file, and a method to force reload the map.
Added utility methods like Utility.CalculateMinutesUntilMorning, CalculateMinutesUntilMorning, ExpandRectangle, and GetOppositeFacingDirection.
Added Object.needsToBeDonated() helper method.
Added audio context to methods like Game1.changeMusicTrack. If the context changes, any audio playing for the current context will end automatically.
Added light context (similar to previous).
Added two new stats to Game1.stats: exMemoriesWiped and childrenTurnedToDoves.
Added option for invisible NPCs gone from the game temporarily (NPC.IsInvisible and NPC.daysUntilNotInvisible).
Added WindowLight map properties.
Added option for temporarily invisible/passable placed items (Object.isTemporarilyInvisible).
Added farmer.isUnclaimedFarmhand to distinguish a farmhand that hasn't been customised by a player yet.
Added kent option for the $d dialogue command.
Added %revealtaste dialogue token, which marks a gift taste revealed in the NPC profile.
Added %endearment and %endearmentlower dialogue tokens which returns a random choice from Pookie, Love, Hot Stuff, Cuddlebug, Hunky (male) or Peach (female), Cutie, Ducky, Handsome (male) or Darling (female), Sweetie, Dear, Honey, Hun, Sweetheart, or the player name.
Projectiles can now have a max travel distance.
The Category field is now part of Item, so code like (item as StardewValley.Object)?.Category can be rewritten as item.Category.
Debug command changes
This section is mainly intended for wiki maintainers; see Modding:Console commands for the general documentation.
Added macro support. Create a text file in the game folder like do_thing.txt with one chat debug command per line (like /seenmail ccMovieTheater or /warp Town 95 55), then enter debug rm do_thing to execute the commands.
All debug command names are now case-insensitive.
Many commands now allow partial matches (e.g., "Abig" will match "Abigail").
Added commands:
addHour
addMinute
addQuartz
allMailRead
animationPreviewTool/apt
broadcastMail

clearBuffs

Content Patcher
Possible breaking changes
Notable changes which may break Content Patcher packs (and XNB mods):
The DivorceBook and MayorFridge tile actions now only work in Lewis' house.
See update impact below.
Other notable changes
These are changes which might be of interest to modders, but shouldn't break any mods.
The display name field is now used in English for the Data/BigCraftablesInformation and Data/ObjectInformation assets.
Added various tilesheets for new content.
Added cat/dog breeds. The Animals/cat and Animals/dog assets are for the base breeds, with two more assets each (e.g., Animals/cat1) for the other breeds.
Added an animation preview tool. This lets you preview player animations for your current character, optionally changing the hair/shirt/pants/gender. You can access it by entering debug animationPreviewTool or debug apt in the SMAPI console.
Added special after-wedding dialogue in Strings/StringsFromCSFiles, in the form {spouseName}_AfterWedding.
Added schedule commands: MAIL, no_schedule.
Event changes:
Added event preconditions: O npc_name (is married to NPC); L (has upgraded farmhouse); U day_count (no festivals within the specified number of days from the event).
Added commands: bgColor, emilyClothes, makeInvisible, marniepainting, marucomet, money, samboombox showItemsLost, tossConcession. Added new event reward samBoombox.
itemAboveHead now also accepts jukebox and samBoombox arguments argument.
awardFestivalPrize now also accepts emilyclothes, jukebox, marniepainting, and samBoombox arguments.
Update impact
Here's a summary of the XNB files which changed in Stardew Valley 1.4.
Notes:
This ignores text changes in non-English files for simplicity.
New content files aren't listed, since they won't impact existing mods.
XNB mods are disproportionately affected, since they replace the entire file. Content Patcher packs are typically unaffected unless they replace the entire file (in which case see the XNB mod column).
I don't know what changed in affected map files (if anything), only that the files are different.
Shorthand:
'broken' means removing new content or potentially important changes, or potentially causing significant display bugs. This is a broad category — the game may work fine without it or crash, depending how it uses that specific content.
'mostly unaffected' means mods will only be affected if they edit specific entries or fields.
Blank means zero expected impact.
