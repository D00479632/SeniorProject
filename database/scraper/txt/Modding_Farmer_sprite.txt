Associated files location
All the sprites for the farmer are stored in "Content/Characters/Farmer". The main sprite for the male farmer is "farmer_base.xnb" and for the female farmer is "farmer_girl_base.xnb".
Layers
The farmer sprite is drawn in several layers. On the bottom layer is the head, torso, and boots. The clothing, accessories, hair, and others are all drawn in multiple layers on top in this order:
Head/Torso/Boots - Bottom layer
Pants
Shirt
Accessories (e.g., glasses, makeup, earrings, facial hair)
Hair
Hat
Arms - Top layer
The placement of layers stored in other files (such as the height of a shirt on the body) is dependent upon the animation, and cannot be modified by editing png files other than by shifting the accessory within its frame.
Farmer (girl) base
The farmer base sprite is divided into three sections. The Head/Torso/Boots layer are in the six columns on the far left. The pants are in the six columns on the far right. And the arms make up the central 12 columns. Each sprite is 16 pixels wide by 32 pixels tall.
The sorting of the sprites seems to be fairly logical with the six pants on the top row lining up with the six torsos on the top row, and similarly all the way down.
With the default shirts and pants, it is unnecessary to have a full torso drawn since the shirts cover most of it up. The pants cover up all of where the legs would go on the torso layer too. However, with mods that add more clothing options for shirts and pants, it can be necessary to have more torso drawn and legs added to the base farmer layer.
Color palette
When editing the farmer base, it is important to use the appropriate color palettes. The game identifies skin, eyes, boots, pants, arms, and shirt sleeves in the farmer base using the color. The game recolors these depending upon the options chosen during character creation and the color of the boots being worn.
Shirt size difference
Although the torso can be up to 16 pixels wide, shirts (which are stored in a separate file) are only 8x8 and unable to fully-cover a torso wider than that. The Hats, Accessories, and Pants all give full 16-pixel wide columns for covering the head and legs, though.
Hats and Hairstyles
The farmer's hairstyle will sometimes change when a hat is equipped.source
Hairstyle 3 will change to hairstyle 11
Hairstyles 22 and 26 will change to hairstyle 7.
Hairstyles 18, 19, 21, and 31 will change to hairstyle 23
Hairstyles 0, 2, 4, 7(?), 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 will change to hairstyle 30.
Hairstyles 1, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30 will not change.
Note: It seems strange that hairstyle 7 would change to 30, so it may actually stay the same.
Sprite Index Breakdown
As mentioned above, the pants, head/torso/boots, and arms all appear to line up. As all of the following information was tested specifically for pants, the illustrations will cover pants, but it most likely also covers head/torso/boots and arms.
Notation
The notation used here is R1F1 = Row 1 Frame 1 , and so on. In the code (which is located in FarmerSprite.cs), frame numbers are 0-indexed and go in order. The code notation is provided after the Row-Frame notation, with duration of each frame (in milliseconds) specified by the number after the @ symbol. For example, 1@60 is the Row 1, Frame 2 frame for duration 60.
In these notes, down refers to the farmer facing downwards (towards the screen), while up refers to the farmer facing upwards (away from the screen). Left and right are from the perspective of the player (screen left/screen right). As the left and right animations are universally mirror images of each other, they are always combined. The player facing to the right is the unflipped sprite, while facing left is flipped.
For the accompanying images, as they are quite large, they are displayed at small size, but if you click through you can see them larger. The male farmer side is greyed out, as this analysis was conducted with the female farmer base, but it should be exactly analogous. There is an extra small sprite at the bottom for the pants item inventory sprite.

Farmer Basic Tool and Weapon Use
Heavy Tools
Note: all frames are sped up by a factor of 0.66 when the Swift enchantment is applied to the tool. The second to last frame (frame 69, or 51, or ) is held for an additional 30*toolPower, where toolPower reflects the level of the held-down upgraded hoe or watering can (ex. showing 3 squares = level 1). This is all very fiddly and annoying.
Axe/pickaxe/hoe/club special down: R12F1, R12F2, R12F3, R12F4, R12F5, cycles once (frame indexes 66@150, 67@40, 68@40, 69@170, 70@75)
Upgraded hoe held down: R12F1 (until highlighted tiles show up), R13F3 (until increases >3 tiles), R13F4 (until releases), then the normal tool animation (frame indexes 66, 74, 75)
Axe/pickaxe/hoe/club special left and right: R9F1, R9F2, R9F3, R9F4, R9F5, cycles once (frame indexes 48@100, 49@40, 50@40, 51@220, 52@75)
Upgraded hoe held left and right: R9F1 (until highlighted tiles show up), R13F1 (until increases >3 tiles), R13F2 (until releases), then the normal tool animation (frame indexes 48, 72, 73)
Axe/pickaxe/hoe/club special up: R7F1, R7F2, R7F3, R11F4, R11F3, cycles once (frame indexes 36@100, 37@40, 38@40, 63@220, 62@75)
Upgraded hoe held up: R7F1 (until highlighted tiles show up), R13F5 (until increases >3 tiles), R13F6 (until releases), then the normal tool animation (frame indexes 36, 76, 77)
Scythe/Melee Weapons
Here, swipeSpeed is some number that depends on the weapon speed.
Swords: swipeSpeed = 6.5 * (10 - (weapon speed + farmer added speed)) * (1 - (farmer weapon speed modifier))
Clubs: swipeSpeed = 10.4 * (10 - (weapon speed + farmer added speed)) * (1 - (farmer weapon speed modifier))
Scythe/melee down: R5F1, R5F2, R5F3, R5F4, R5F5, R5F6, cycles once (frame indexes 24@55, 25@45, 26@25, 27@25, 28@25, 29@swipeSpeed)
Scythe/melee left and right: R6F1, R6F2, R6F3, R6F4, R6F5, R6F6, cycles once (frame indexes 30@55, 31@45, 32@25, 33@25, 34@25, 35@swipeSpeed)
Scythe/melee up: R7F1, R7F2, R7F3, R7F4, R7F5, R7F6, cycles once (frame indexes 36@55, 37@45, 38@25, 39@25, 40@25, 41@swipeSpeed)
Daggers
Daggers: swipeSpeed = 10 * (10 - (weapon speed + farmer added speed)) * (1 - (farmer weapon speed modifier))
Not sure exactly how swipeSpeed from daggers plays in. Most likely it's passed in as interval.
Dagger down: R5F2, R5F4 (frame indexes 25@interval, 27@interval)
Dagger left and right: R6F5, R6F4 (frame indexes 34@interval, 33@interval)
Dagger up: R7F5, R7F3 (frame indexes 40@interval, 38@interval)
Dagger special: dagger repeated several times very fast
Watering Can
Watering down: R10F1, R10F2, R5F2, cycles once (frame indexes 54@75, 55@100, 25@500)
Watering left and right: R10F5, R10F6, R8F4, cycles once (frame indexes 58@75, 59@100, 45@500)

Sword sp. left and right: R6F5, held (frame index 34)

Slingshot left and right: R8F2 (frame index 43)
Slingshot up: R8F3 (frame index 44)

Casting down: R12F1, held, then rest of heavy tool animation (frame indexes 66@100, 67@40, 68@40, 69@80, 70@200)
Casting left and right: R9F1, held, then R9F2, R9F3, R9F4, R9F5 (frame indexes 48@100, 49@40, 50@40, 51@80, 52@200)
Casting up: R13F5, held, then R7F3, R11F4, R11F3, repeat last two (frame indexes 76@100, 38@40, 63@40, 62@80, 63@200)

Farmer Miscellaneous Movement
Passing Out
This seems to be the same animation both for passing out due to low energy, passing out due to 2:00 AM, and passing out due to low health, but I have not confirmed the last one.
Passing out: R3F5, R1F1, R3F5, R1F5, R1F6 (frame indexes 16@1000, 0@500, 16@1000, 4@200, 5@6000)
