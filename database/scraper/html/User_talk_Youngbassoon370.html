<p>So I was playing on PlayStation 4 and found a big bug where i finished the pantry bundle, but I've waited a week to have Mrs. Mullner come to give me the recipe for the <a href="/Garden_Pot" title="Garden Pot">Garden Pot</a>, but it never happened. If anyone has any info how to fix this bug, plz help me <a href="/User:Youngbassoon370" title="User:Youngbassoon370">Youngbassoon370</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 17:27, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>I even checked the parameters (6:00 to 11:30) but it still didn't work. <a href="/User:Youngbassoon370" title="User:Youngbassoon370">Youngbassoon370</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 17:30, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>I do not know anything about that, but you could ask <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">User:margotbean</a> on their talk page, because so many people see it. <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Fnaticlyric560" title="User talk:Fnaticlyric560">talk</a>) 17:46, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>You could also try to post about it on the stardew valley forums. <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Fnaticlyric560" title="User talk:Fnaticlyric560">talk</a>) 17:46, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
