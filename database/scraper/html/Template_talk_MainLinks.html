<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Broken_Links">Broken Links</span></h2>
<p>I mentioned this issue and the one below on the <a href="/Talk:Stardew_Valley_Wiki#Some_missing_things" title="Talk:Stardew Valley Wiki">main page's talk page</a>, but I'm noting them here as well to be thorough. The current link out to the PS4 store page for Stardew Valley is broken, and can be updated to <a class="external free" href="https://www.playstation.com/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow">https://www.playstation.com/games/stardew-valley/</a>. This link appears twice, as part of the PS4 button (left side) and in the version history list (right side). - <a href="/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:13, 1 March 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Yep, I checked it out, and the English site works fine (the PS site redirects me based on my language), but when I try other regions, the page is broken.  For example, the German site is <a class="external free" href="https://store.playstation.com/de-de/product/EP2319-CUSA26625_00-2010147637670638" rel="nofollow">https://store.playstation.com/de-de/product/EP2319-CUSA26625_00-2010147637670638</a>, the Italian site is <a class="external free" href="https://store.playstation.com/it-it/product/EP2319-CUSA26625_00-2010147637670638" rel="nofollow">https://store.playstation.com/it-it/product/EP2319-CUSA26625_00-2010147637670638</a>, but "https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP2319-CUSA26625_00-2010147637670638" doesn't work. Up until recently, the page said "do not Allow" or something similar for every region except the US, and had no actual game info on it.  So, I'm waiting for the PS store to fix its site before I make changes.  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:27, 1 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Huh, for me the PS4 links on the English wiki redirect to the main page of the PlayStation store. Does the link I provided in my first message also work for you? It may be best to make the change anyway if the current link isn't working for everyone. And that's a good point about other languages, I would imagine languages sites of EU countries (Dutch, French, etc.) would need new links due to the issues the game had getting re-approved in certain regions by Sony. The game just got re-added to the store this past week in those places, so there should be (new) valid links now. I can go through and find the new links for those regions if that would be helpful. - <a href="/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:12, 2 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm sorry, I meant the new link you provided works well for me, it redirects me to the en-us page just fine!  It's the other languages that don't redirect, as far as I can tell, when using the link you provided ( <a class="external free" href="https://www.playstation.com/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow">https://www.playstation.com/games/stardew-valley/</a> ).  I had to switch regions and then search for the game, which led me to the links I gave above for the other languages.  Prior to this week, the site for other languages was truly borked, as the game didn't seem to be available.  I'm waiting to see if Sony fixes its website before I change the links.  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 02:45, 3 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ah, no problem on the confusion, that's on me as well for misunderstanding. The other region links you shared seem to work for me. I would think now that Stardew has been reapproved by Sony in the EU that those listings should be correct now. - <a href="/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:12, 11 March 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I only just got around to updating the console version history page, but Switch is now on 1.5.4.1, I'm not sure if other consoles got this update. I figured I could just add this on to this section, so I changed the title. - <a href="/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:14, 11 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>In <a class="external text" href="https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/bug-blue-floor-on-island.5398/post-33081" rel="nofollow">this post</a>, someone reported a fix for PS4 on Feb. 16.  No one reported a fix for Xbox... I guess someone has to ping CA and ask for the versions and release dates?  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:50, 11 March 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Should the "Computer version" be updated to 1.6.8 to reflect the latest version? – <a href="/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:59, 14 July 2024 (UTC)
