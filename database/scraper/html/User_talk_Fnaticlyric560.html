<p>Hi! I'd be happy to help you with your project! Trouble is, I don't have much experience with the dye pots in Haley's and Emily's house, so I don't know which objects correspond to which dye pot colors! If you could send me a spreadsheet or something of the sort that lists every item that can be used to dye objects and what colors they correspond to that would be very helpful. <a href="/User:User314159" title="User:User314159">User314159</a> (<a href="/User_talk:User314159" title="User talk:User314159">talk</a>) 01:17, 8 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>If you go to the <a href="/Dyeing" title="Dyeing">Dyeing</a> page, scroll down to the dye pots section of the page, and below the lengthy description, you will find a complete list of all items usable to dye with of each color. I have competed 3/4 of the red section so if you can do the orange section, that would be great! I have been copy and pasting the same thing for each page in the tailoring section. You can go ahead and create your own variation of what I have been using, or just change out the word 'red' for orange. Below this is what I have been using:
"It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located in <a href="/Haley" title="Haley">Haley</a>'s and <a href="/Emily" title="Emily">Emily</a>'s house, <a href="/2_Willow_Lane" title="2 Willow Lane">2 Willow Lane</a>."
I usually change it a little to fit into previous text, but it seems to be working. Thanks for helping! (I have literally asked 6 different people, and you are the only one to even respond!) :D <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 01:34, 8 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>Also, if you need another example, just look at the Tailoring section of the <a href="/Magma_Geode" title="Magma Geode">Magma Geode</a> page. <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 01:38, 8 September 2021 (UTC)

<p>Hello, Fnaticlyric560. I am new to the wiki, and would like some advise when it comes to editing, as I have no previous wiki editing experience. Can you help me? <a href="/User:Spaceman882" title="User:Spaceman882">Spaceman882</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Spaceman882" title="User talk:Spaceman882">talk</a>) 02:05, 8 September 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Sure! I figured out what to do and what NOT to do because of <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">User:Margotbean</a>, an admin for the wiki. I reccomend reading the <a href="/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">help:editing</a> page to get started. It pretty much answers any questions you may have. Enjoy, and welcome to the wiki! :) <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 02:08, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hello Fnaticlyric! There's a place for you to show off your farms (present and future) on the official forums: <a class="external free" href="https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/valley-showcase.15/" rel="nofollow">https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/valley-showcase.15/</a>
</p><p>The wiki isn't really the place for such a personal file. I'll give you a day or so to copy it to your computer, then I'm going to have to delete it. So sorry, <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:49, 24 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>Sorry about that! I accedentally downloaded the wrong file to the wiki (I  was trying to do something else) and by the time I realised it, it was too late. After that, I lost track of the file. Whoops! <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:34, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>Go ahead and delete it, I already had it saved on my chromebook. The pic was a plan for what me and my siblings wanted our farm together to eventually look like. <a href="/User:Fnaticlyric560" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:41, 25 September 2021 (UTC)
