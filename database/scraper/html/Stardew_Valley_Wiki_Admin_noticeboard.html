<p>Hello dear Admin.
I'm not sure what's going on but this has been happening for months however it hasn't always been like this. I can't remember when it started but it's been at least I believe six months. I thought it could have been my extentions but I tested and it wasn't. I'm using Opera GX and I checked with Google and this didn't happen. Could it be Opera GX interacting in some way? Is it a glitch? The only way I can describe it is that it looks like black and white were inverted and maybe the color contrast was cranked up. Any idea how to fix this if it's not a bug? <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Tiptoe50&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Tiptoe50 (page does not exist)">Tiptoe50</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Tiptoe50&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Tiptoe50 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:47, 4 June 2023

<p>The homepage has an image at the top saying "Stardew Valley 1.5". It is now 1.6. I have attached another image with the 1.6 version from Concerned Ape's blog if you want to use that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trying_to_update_mystery_box_page">Trying to update mystery box page</span></h2>
<p>I was trying to edit the contents on the <a href="/Mystery_Box" title="Mystery Box">Mystery Box</a> page to be in charts like how the geode content tables are organized, but I got the pop-up that it was too big of an edit for a new editor to make. I don't know if this is the best way to alert someone that I am trying to do this genuinely, or if someone here can even grant me the permission to make that edit. If someone else has to make the edit, that's understandable, but I was really excited to do it! <a href="/User:RaeOSunshine24" title="User:RaeOSunshine24">RaeOSunshine24</a> (<a href="/User_talk:RaeOSunshine24" title="User talk:RaeOSunshine24">talk</a>) 20:48, 25 March 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Don't know how to solve this but just curious on your approach, have you considered a table like <a href="/Fishing#Treasure_Chests" title="Fishing">Treasure Chests</a> as well?

<dl><dd><dl><dd>My first instinct was to have the items split into multiple charts because there are so many different categories of items (crafting, clothing, special items, recipes, etc.) but I'm not married to it!

<dl><dd>I changed my approach and am now trying to adjust it just so it matches the content chart on the  <a href="/Golden_Mystery_Box" title="Golden Mystery Box">Golden Mystery Box</a> page, but that's still too big of an edit apparently :( again, someone else is welcome to do it, I just find the current way it's organized hard to read! <a href="/User:RaeOSunshine24" title="User:RaeOSunshine24">RaeOSunshine24</a> (<a href="/User_talk:RaeOSunshine24" title="User talk:RaeOSunshine24">talk</a>) 12:26, 26 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_external_links_to_Modding:Mod_compatibility">Adding external links to Modding:Mod compatibility</span></h2>
<p>I am trying to edit the page of Modding:Mod compatibility and update the mods to their unofficial version that I found on github however I'm blocked because I'm adding external links. I've made more than a dozens of edits to contribute to this page which shares its data with smapi.com/mods for a lot of users. I tried copying the format of other mods who had "github.com" in their block of code but couldn't have my changes accepted as the format was impossible to mimic. I've encountered an automatic message to message moderator and when searching for that word i was directed to this section of the site, I hope this is the correct procedure to go
</p><p>In short I'd like a solution for a workaround or permission to add these two block of codes as replacement to the currently mods with the status <i>broken</i> <b>(it might be better to view the text below in source code along with the mod page in source code on the side to understand better</b>):

<p>After the move we should also set up a template <b>Template:DehydratorProductivity-top</b> to match <a href="/Template:KegProductivity-top" title="Template:KegProductivity-top">Template:KegProductivity-top</a>.

<p>Hello, I'm not entirely sure how to contact administrators directly so I'm posting here.  I did testing on all the new crops (Carrot, Summer Squash, Broccoli, and Powdermelon) and formatted everything to add to the Crop Growth Calendars page, but my edit was blocked as I'm a fairly new user.  I have all 6 "sub-calendars" ready for all the crops and have the code written out ready to add in.  Everything is in line with the existing formatting / layout and the preview looked perfect.  I'd love to get these added for everyone to use but I'm assuming my account needs to be approved or something along those lines.  I read the Help Editing page in advance and went out of my way to make a handful of minor edits and even made sure to add and verify my email before I tried adding these, but it seems that wasn't enough to allow me to add the calendars.  I'm hoping this is the correct place to post this--please let me know what I need to do so I can get these added.  Thank you so much!!  <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:KrobusFanClub&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:KrobusFanClub (page does not exist)">KrobusFanClub</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:KrobusFanClub&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:KrobusFanClub (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:51, 6 May 2024 (UTC)
</p><p>I've uploaded a screenshot of the edit preview for the Powdermelon Crop Growth Calendars to show what I'm trying to add.  I made more minor edits in an attempt to clear the threshold but I'm still unable to add these in.  I'm not sure if there's a certain number of minor edits I need to hit, a time window I need to reach, or possibly both--all would make sense, and I completely understand why these limitations are in place!  I just really want to add these calendars in so just let me know what I have to do on my end to make that possible.  I'll mark that screenshot to delete as soon as I can get this resolved.

<p>I don't want to judge who's right or wrong in this minor incident, but I came to check things out since I saw them complaining about this.
</p><p>Given that <a href="/User:Insanity_Studios" title="User:Insanity Studios">Insanity Studios</a> has been banned in the main namespace due to repeated bad edits, do we really need to keep his permissions in the discussion namespace? Unless you genuinely believe that his constant <i>suggestions</i> will contribute anything meaningful to the wiki?
</p><p>I don't want to come off as impolite. We understand the efforts that go into maintaining the wiki as administrators. If that's the case, why allow behavior that only adds unnecessary workload? 
</p><p>I understand there's a rule in the discussion space about <i>Don't delete discussions,</i> but does that mean I can post anything at will, including meaningless content or even spam? We want to make the wiki better, but do we really need to tolerate and make concessions for this kind of behavior?

<dl><dd>Hello, Margotbean! I hope you are doing well.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>We have to use firm statements to stop that disruptive individual from editing; we have no other choice. I reminded him to read Help:Editing, but it was not helpful. He continues to create chaos on the talk page. All of his ideas seem meaningless, and no one is willing to incorporate them into the pages.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>骑凤散人 attempted to clean up the mess, but you reverted his edits. I empathize with both him and you. However, it is difficult to determine who is right or wrong in this situation. You mentioned,  all hope this wiki becomes the best wiki. all share that sentiment. Both you and we are doing our best to make that a reality.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I hope we can completely ban the creator of the mess. I know that using rude statements is wrong; we should be more polite in reminding him of that. Could you please think twice? All of us are looking forward to seeing you change your mind.</dd></dl>

<p>Hello,
</p><p>I just noticed that the new update 1.6.9 is currently not listed on the main page, but it has been released for iOS / iPadOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PS4 / PS5. I wanted to ask an admin if he/she can edit the main page to change the version numbers.

I noticed that the cindersap forest tab on the home wiki page, didn't have the raccoon's wife's shop. I was wondering if that was supposed to be on the Cindersap forest tab.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Server_instability_Nov_2024">Server instability Nov 2024</span></h2>
<p>Is there something going on with the wiki server? Since 1.6.9 released my bookmarked searches have been failing even though the URLs match the local search URL format precisely. Searching locally is also very slow. I just tried to log in to post about it and the server crashed entirely for a few minutes leaving only the Cloudflare cache, which is obviously only viable for anons. Previewing and submitting this question has also been really slow. Half of my pageloads have no CSS or partial CSS. Is it just excessive normal traffic? Have you blocked remote referers from searching? <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:OnionNinja&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:OnionNinja (page does not exist)">OnionNinja</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:OnionNinja&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:OnionNinja (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:21, 20 November 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Furniture_large_edit_revert"><a href="/Furniture" title="Furniture">Furniture</a> large edit revert</span></h2>
<p>I thought that the formatting was really bad on that page. The first issue was that tons of unneded and obvious info was repeated, like the fact that all catalogue items cost 0G when bought in the catalogue. The second issue was with the user experience - it was really hard to tell at a glance which items were available from a catalogue and which weren't. All in all, it seemed like the tables were prioritizing space efficiency over user experience.
</p><p>So, I decided to remake it, and you can see my finished result <a class="external text" href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Furniture&amp;oldid=183857" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 10 hours later, it was reverted without explanation. I don't want to start an edit war, so I'm requesting the permission to revert it back and assurance that it won't be reverted again.
</p><p>Also, the icons I uploaded for use in the rewrite were deleted without explanation as well.
</p><p><b>My apolocheese, I read the rules and it seems like I needed to discuss the edit with others if it's a large formatting edit. Let this be a discussion thread then</b>
</p><p><b>Actually, I'll move this to the Furniture talk page</b>

<p>I attempted to add a trivia item on the Spirit's Eve page regarding the TV set in the maze.  It included a link to the Wikipedia page for <i>Ringu</i>, a horror film that the TV reminded me of.  The auto-system balked at the external link.
