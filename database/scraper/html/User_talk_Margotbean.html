<h2><span id="RE:_Journal_Scrap_#9_solution_order"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="RE:_Journal_Scrap_.239_solution_order">RE: Journal Scrap #9 solution order</span></h2>
<p>Hello MargotBean, I hope you are well. The upkeep of the wiki has been amazing throughout these past upgrades to v1.6+. A certain issue in the wiki has bothered me for some time. RE: Journal Scrap #9, in the solution section, the 2 solutions were listed in the wrong order. The note hints, "<i>Aye... stones as big as '<b>ones'</b> and stones as big as '<b>fives'</b> were they...</i>" therefore the numbers directly <b>UNDER</b> the images should be the 2nd shown sequence of "2 clicks, 11 clicks, 9 clicks, 5 clicks, 7 clicks" because this corresponds to the note's hint (2 small stones = 2), (2 large + 1 small = 11), (1 large + 4 small = 9), (1 large = 5), and finally (1 large + 2 small = 7). Then the 2nd sequence, which is 1 note less on each stone than the hint implies, listed as an alternative solution. I believe this alternative may seem to work better for some players not on PC (mobile possibly) but it is not the solution to the hint in the note and should be relegated to the second row. I made the change today, I just don't know how, or if, I'm supposed to do this in other languages.
Best Regards,

Edit: I also belatedly just made this adjustment on the <i>Ginger Island / Mermaid</i> section to switch the order of the 2 solutions (I didn't initially realize it was in another location). Both of these were done on the English wiki only.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>That sounds fine, and thanks for your note! Interestingly enough, there was a survey among testers when 1.5 was in beta asking if they thought "5" meant "5 clicks" or "get the flute block to the 5th note". I think musically inclined people (like ConcernedApe) might think differently about the puzzle than others. I can't remember the results of the survey, unfortunately... <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 01:07, 10 January 2025 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hmmm, interesting indeed. I guess I don't see the difference. When 2 big stones will equal 10 and 1 small stone is 1, then 11 "clicks", or "Check / Do Action / Use Cursor" on whatever platform, would bring that fluteblock for the 2nd grouping to its 11th note and thus create the correct sound at that point in the riddle. Maybe "<i>clicks</i>" is not the best wording then? Thanks again, be well. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Carpediem&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Carpediem (page does not exist)">Carpediem</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Carpediem" title="User talk:Carpediem">talk</a>) 20:56, 10 January 2025 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm going to give a quick code insight by the way and note that the game only cares about relative pitch; in fact, this means that the first note block can be *any value* and as long as you go the correct amount up and down for each following block it's valid. The only limitation is that you can't loop around the 24, but that still means there are as many as 16 different valid solutions. So while it's peculiar, 0 9 7 3 5 clicks and 15 24 22 18 20 clicks both work. I don't know if you want to include that or not but it does make saying there's just 2 is incorrect. But I suppose the two listed are the two most intended solutions.<a href="/User:CandyNim" title="User:CandyNim">CandyNim</a> (<a href="/User_talk:CandyNim" title="User talk:CandyNim">talk</a>) 06:43, 11 January 2025 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thank you, that's very interesting. In the beginning there was just the one solution in the wiki and it corresponded to the actual Stone Tuning Key image and the visible position of the stones. A second solution was added at some point and I believe this one was easier for mobile users for some reason (at least according to the SDV subreddit) but it was placed directly under the image, moving the actual solution for the image down a line, with the new solution being incongruous with the Key image. I'm happy it's moved back to its original position.<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Carpediem&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Carpediem (page does not exist)">Carpediem</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Carpediem" title="User talk:Carpediem">talk</a>) 21:18, 6 February 2025 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Templates_for_Mobile-View">Templates for Mobile-View</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean,<br/>
I mostly use the wiki on my phone - have you ever thought about creating/ adjusting templates for mobile view?<br/>
MediaWiki knows the markups for "mobile only" or "mobile-hidden".<br/>
When i worked on a wiki, we created a lot of templates that way. mostly were there only small adjustments eg. description in row below, instead a column on the right - to decrease the width and make tables fitting for smaller screens. <br/> Would be nice to hear from you, about that idea. i am pretty sure, it would please a lot of users! <br/>

<p>Hey margotbean, I just want to apologise for changing the information on the eggplant parmesan page. I promise I wasn't just trying to mess with it.

<p>Hi, you've reverted my latest changes on Strawberry growth chart. Given this is just an addition of two columns, I'm surprised to see it reverted. I understood previous changes being reverted when I added all the growth charts as there is a desire to keep the page simple and making that sort of change across all the languages would likely be taxing, but in this case even on mobile I don't see this as a major change adding 2 columns to 5. I don't see this as a major formatting change but let me know if I'm not correct.

<dl><dd>Yes, communication is important. I spend the bulk of my time communicating with editors, and so the needed content updates get pushed further down the list. So, two of my reasons are these:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Jas_and_Marnie">Jas and Marnie</span></h2>
<p>Why do you keep reverting my edits to the relationships panel for the Jas and Marnie pages? Marnie *is* Jas's adoptive aunt; to imply that they are actually related causes a lot confusion for players trying to figure out the actual relationship between them. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Sinksforsauce11&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Sinksforsauce11 (page does not exist)">Sinksforsauce11</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sinksforsauce11&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Sinksforsauce11 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:21, 17 February 2025 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>There is no reason given in the game to think that Marnie formally adopted Jas. There is also no reason to think that Marnie is not Jas' aunt by blood. ConcernedApe left the relationship vague, and so should the wiki. <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 17:26, 17 February 2025 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>There is no reason to think that they are related by blood; Jas's parents are specifically stated to have been "good friends" with Shane, *not* in any way related to him -- if they were related, ConcernedApe would have said so, instead of calling them friends. Marnie never refers to Jas as her niece in any of her dialogue lines; it is a big jump logically to assume that they are blood related. The wiki is not staying "vague" when the information it states is never provided in the game -- it is simply reflecting YOUR views on what the relationship must be, when those are not actually based in reality. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Sinksforsauce11&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Sinksforsauce11 (page does not exist)">Sinksforsauce11</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sinksforsauce11&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Sinksforsauce11 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:38, 17 February 2025 (UTC)
