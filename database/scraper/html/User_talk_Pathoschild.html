<p>Cole informed me that the old wiki has no set lifetime, but "they" plan to keep it around as long as possible.  (I think "they" means ChuckleFish).  To me, this says that the old wiki could potentially disappear without warning at any time.  So, we can either make sure every page is archived on the wayback machine, or go with your template and archived pages.  (I choose the second option 😛)  
</p><p>I've restored the admin noticeboard archive and removed the delete tag from the template.  I'm not sure we need all the Admin noticeboard history, but having the last several comments doesn't hurt.  Creating redlinks does hurt my OCD a bit, but we can deal with those over time.

<dl><dd>Sounds good to me! I prefer having the archives on-wiki too, and the redlinks are still useful for finding the user's edits &amp; talk page.

<p>I provided a link to the repository which has 48 SV mods, some of them unique to my knowledge (DarkHax authored mods).
would be neat if you could revert this change, CurseForge is a legit repository for mods for a variety of games, and SV mods are very welcome there!

<dl><dd>Hi! Based on the <a class="external text" href="https://smapi.io/mods" rel="nofollow">mod compatibility data</a>, only 13.7% of CurseForge's SMAPI mods (i.e. nine mods by three authors) are compatible and aren't already on a more popular site. So while <a href="/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Update_checks#Valid_sites" title="Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Update checks">SMAPI itself supports CurseForge</a>, I think it's too small and has too many broken mods to recommend to first-time players in the 'getting started' guide (especially with no way to indicate on CurseForge that a mod is broken). CurseForge mods are already listed in the <a class="external text" href="https://smapi.io/mods" rel="nofollow">mod index</a> though, so it's still discoverable. —<small><a href="/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 19:07, 23 March 2021 (UTC)</small></dd></dl>

<p>Hi - the official forum thread for mobile version 1.5 also lists the patches as they are released and these are taken directly from ConcernedApe's twitter, however you have build 34 listed on the mobile version history which doesn't match up with the January 11 patch notes, take a look here for the forum thread: <a class="external free" href="https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/report-1-5-mobile-issues-here-updated-jan-11.14953/" rel="nofollow">https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/report-1-5-mobile-issues-here-updated-jan-11.14953/</a>
</p><p>This is going to confuse people. I see that you obtained the latest notes from a decompile. I think it would be best if the Wiki only contained the official patch notes from ConcernedApe.

<dl><dd>Hi! That forum post shows release notes for 1.5.6.32/33/35, and silently skips 1.5.6.34. It's not unusual for an update to have missing or incomplete release notes, which is one of the reasons the wiki isn't just a copy &amp; paste of the official notes. It does link to the announcement (when there is one) so you can see the original release notes (if any). I added 1.5.6.35 to the wiki and asked Magically Clueless to add version numbers to her post though, which should both reduce confusion. Thanks for pointing it out! —<small><a href="/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 17:53, 11 January 2023 (UTC)</small></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Text_within_Wikipedia_pages">Text within Wikipedia pages</span></h2>
<p>Hello <a href="/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a>, since v1.6 is now out, I feel like the Wiki needs a clean-up, and that is that the Wiki pages use capital letters for the links, they need to be lowercased to match paragraphs in proper English, unless if it's the start of a paragraph, proper nouns, bold text at the start of a page, or the name of a <a href="/Villagers" title="Villagers">villager</a>. This will improve the language of the Wiki and make it easier to read. Please work on this Pathoschild, thank you. <a href="/User:9000" title="User:9000">9000</a> (<a href="/User_talk:9000" title="User talk:9000">talk</a> • <a href="/Special:Contributions/9000" title="Special:Contributions/9000">contributions</a>) 10:20, 20 March 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>9000, I've asked you before to stop nit-picking capitalization in a language that is not your first language. Please stop pestering other folks. <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:52, 20 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Hi! I wouldn't mind a discussion about capitalization, but we shouldn't make large-scale changes like that without reaching a consensus first. I mainly work on modding and technical pages though, so margotbean would be the main person to discuss general content style with. —<small><a href="/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 23:09, 20 March 2024 (UTC)</small></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hello <a href="/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a>, <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">Margotbean</a> is saying that English is not my first language and says that my edits do not improve the Wiki, especially when <b>changing links</b>. English only uses capital letters at the start of paragraphs or proper nouns, you changed the <a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">Version History</a> page in lowercasing links, but Margotbean didn't care about you doing it, she cares about us doing it. The Wiki is the exact opposite for the most part, it really needs to be <b>matching</b> paragraphs in proper English, she doesn't care about <b>adding</b> links, but when <b>changing</b> them. Also in her <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">user page</a>, it reads <i>If you need to contact me about Wiki issues, feel free to post.</i> When you do that, she doesn't give a response about what you wrote to her at all. Margotbean hates me now. Please reply to her <a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk page</a> about all of this, thank you so much. <a href="/User:9000" title="User:9000">9000</a> (<a href="/User_talk:9000" title="User talk:9000">talk</a> • <a href="/Special:Contributions/9000" title="Special:Contributions/9000">contributions</a>) 05:18, 21 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I prefer lowercase too, but I don't think it's as straightforward as you suggest. An argument can be made both for treating page names as regular text (like <a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">version history</a>) or as page titles (like <a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">Version History</a>). There's also precedent in wiki tradition, since the earliest wikis used <a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">VersionHistory</a> (one word with capitals) to indicate page links.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I also don't think it's a question of favouritism, since Margotbean and I have definitely argued and disagreed before. There's a distinction between the content articles (which use capitalized links) and technical documentation pages (which use lowercase links). The two sections of the wiki have somewhat different audiences and style conventions (e.g. technical documentation tends to prefer named links over naked links), and <a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">Version History</a> (or <a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">version history</a>?) falls somewhere between the two so it can go either way.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>So I'm fine discussing the capitalization conventions, but we shouldn't just change the convention used by each section without agreeing on the changes first. —<small><a href="/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 06:12, 21 March 2024 (UTC)</small></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree with these changes, but another thing while we're at it, the Wiki uses a <b>lot</b> of errors in links, which need to be fixed, for example: <code>the [[The Mines|Mines]]</code> looks like gibberish to me, so I change it to the following coding: <code>[[the Mines]]</code>. The capitalization of links shouldn't just be all capitals, as it makes it bad for reading, for example: <code>[[Cave Carrot]]s</code> should look like the following: <code>[[Cave Carrot|cave carrots]]</code>. This doesn't affect the targeted page or create a redlink, but titles it to lowercase letters instead of capital letters. Hopefully this will be changed to match proper English. <a href="/User:9000" title="User:9000">9000</a> (<a href="/User_talk:9000" title="User talk:9000">talk</a> • <a href="/Special:Contributions/9000" title="Special:Contributions/9000">contributions</a>) 06:08, 22 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_in_Chinese_Translation">Changes in Chinese Translation</span></h2>
<p>Hello, Pathochild! 
</p><p>I saw that you updated the "Modding: Migration to Stardew Valley 1.6.9" page yesterday, adding a new section called "Name translation changes for wiki maintainers". However, I noticed that the section did not mention any changes regarding the Chinese translation, and I am somewhat concerned about this. 
</p><p>The Chinese translation underwent significant changes in 1.6.4, which sparked intense dissatisfaction among various Chinese forums. In my opinion, part of the reason for this discontent lies in the fact that the translation made substantial unnecessary alterations to content that many players were already familiar with, along with the perceived arrogance displayed by the previous translation team. Subsequently, these changes were reverted back in 1.6.6. Nevertheless, the translation modification actually corrected some long-standing errors, but they were also rolled back together. I am concerned that this matter has had a significant impact on the further improvement of Chinese translation, as it may lead to a more conservative localization of games and a reluctance to make changes. I am concerned that many translation issues may become permanent problems, so I would like to ask: Does this mean that the Chinese translation has not made any changes in 1.6.9 (i.e. no difference from 1.6.8)? 
</p><p>I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my inquiry, as I don't know how to contact the localization team. 
</p><p>I want to express my admiration for your immense contributions to the development of Stardew Valley and the editing of the wiki. Thank you for all your hard work! <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%AA%E7%86%BA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:第二个熺 (page does not exist)">第二个熺</a> (<a href="/User_talk:%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%AA%E7%86%BA" title="User talk:第二个熺">talk</a>) 17:04, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello 第二个熺! The upcoming Stardew Valley 1.6.9 fixes a large number of translation issues across all languages, including Chinese.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mod_compatibility_page">Mod compatibility page</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Pc
</p><p>I just saw that the page was moved and my first reaction was a mild heart attack, something like:
</p>
<dl><dd>WAIT, WHAT?! &gt; WHERE IS THE LIST?! OBSOLETE?! &gt; WHY?!</dd></dl>
<p>Then I went to the history page and fortunately found your edit comment saying this was just a matter of technical issue with MediaWiki etc.
As this page is very important to the wiki, I'd like to suggest 2 tweaks on the current banner:
</p>
<ol><li>Add a very short reason explaining the closure of the page.<br/>(Even if most people don't know what a "template include limit" is, they'll be less distressed knowing that this is just a technical limitation.)</li>
<li>Explicitly say that people can access the list on on smapi.io to "read" it.<br/>(Most users that used to visit that page aren't editors, they're just looking for their beloved mods.)</li></ol>
<p>In the next couple of years, this page will certainly continue to be visited by many users that follow external links or have bookmarked it on their devices... So I thought a more elaborate message could help them.
