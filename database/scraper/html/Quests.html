<p><b>Quests</b> are set objectives that provide rewards when completed. They're kept track of in the quest journal, which can be brought up by clicking the exclamation point icon at the bottom of the date/time display in the upper right of the screen, or by using the hotkey F. Current progress on a quest is shown under the exclamation point as items are collected. Quests are listed in the journal by title, and each quest can be expanded to read the text and requirements for completion. Clicking the X at the top of the window will close it and there's a button under the journal window to cancel the selected quest. 
</p><p>There are two major types of quests, story quests and Help Wanted quests. Story quests are typically received in the mail, but a few are automatically accepted at the beginning of the game to help teach the player about the game.  Story quests can be completed at any time after receiving them; there is no time limit or expiration date.

<p>Every day (except the first day of the game) the bulletin board outside <a href="/Pierre%27s_General_Store" title="Pierre's General Store">Pierre's General Store</a> may have a randomly generated Help Wanted quest that can be completed in exchange for money and sometimes increased <a href="/Friendship" title="Friendship">friendship</a> with the quest giver. When a new quest is available, the bulletin board will have a yellow exclamation point floating above it.

<td style="vertical-align:top; width:100px;"><b>Gathering</b>
</td>
<td><a href="/Clint" title="Clint">Clint</a> will ask the player to collect copper, iron, or gold ores, usually 20-40, or <a href="/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> for him to inspect, or <a href="/Robin" title="Robin">Robin</a> will ask the player to gather <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a> or <a href="/Stone" title="Stone">stone</a>.
<p>Items must be collected <i>after</i> accepting the quest. Items stored in inventory or chests will not work. It is not necessary to have the requested items in inventory to complete a gathering quest.  Once the required number of items have been gathered (as indicated by the counter in the journal), simply talking to the villager who requested the items is sufficient to complete the quest.

</p><p>Once the required number of monsters have been slain (as indicated by the counter in the journal), talking to the villager who made the request will complete it.
</p><p>Note that a villager will never ask a player to slay a monster they do not have access to yet. For example, a quest to slay <a href="/Shadow_Shaman" title="Shadow Shaman">Shadow Shaman</a> will never be asked until the player has reached at least floor 80 of <a href="/The_Mines" title="The Mines">The Mines</a>.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;"><b>Fishing</b>
</td>
<td><a href="/Demetrius" title="Demetrius">Demetrius</a> or <a href="/Willy" title="Willy">Willy</a> will ask the player to catch from 1-5 of a specific <a href="/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> from the current <a href="/Seasons" title="Seasons">season</a>, either to lower the population of that fish or to keep the art of fishing alive.
<p>The reward is the base sell price of the fish × the number of fish requested, and the player gets to keep the fish.
</p><p>Note that it is not necessary to have the requested fish in inventory to complete a fishing quest. Once the required number of fish have been caught (as indicated by the counter in the journal), talking to the villager who made the request will complete it.

<td style="vertical-align:top;"><b>Saying 'Hello'</b>
</td>
<td><a href="/Emily" title="Emily">Emily</a> will ask the player to talk to all the people living in the town.

This quest will only appear after the <a href="#Introductions">"Introductions"</a> quest is completed.
<p>The player will gain 100 <a href="/Friendship" title="Friendship">friendship</a> points with everyone upon completion of this quest.
</p><p>Note that on day 2, the game does not display which villagers were greeted on day 1, but greeting the same villager twice over the 2-day quest does not count.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;"><b>Item Delivery</b>
</td>
<td>This is the most common type of Help Wanted quest. Any adult <a href="/Villagers" title="Villagers">villager</a> that the player has met and can earn friendship with will ask for a random item for various reasons.
<p>This item can be:
</p>
<ul><li>A <a href="/Crops" title="Crops">crop</a>, <a href="/Foraging" title="Foraging">forageable</a>, or <a href="/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> from the current season. Items the player does not have access to will not be requested. For example, <a href="/Sandfish" title="Sandfish">Sandfish</a> will never be requested until the player has unlocked <a href="/The_Desert" title="The Desert">the Desert</a>. <a href="/Purple_Mushroom" title="Purple Mushroom">Purple Mushrooms</a> will not be requested until the player has reached floor 40 of <a href="/The_Mines" title="The Mines">the Mines</a>. However, weather-dependent fish can be requested in any weather.</li>
<li>A <a href="/Minerals#Gems" title="Minerals">gem</a>, once the player has reached the bottom of The Mines.</li>
<li>A metal bar, if the player can <a href="/Crafting" title="Crafting">craft</a> a <a href="/Furnace" title="Furnace">furnace</a>.</li>
<li>An <a href="/Animals" title="Animals">animal product</a>, if the player has an animal that produces it.</li>
<li><a href="/Joja_Cola" title="Joja Cola">Joja Cola</a>, <a href="/Seaweed" title="Seaweed">Seaweed</a>, or <a href="/Green_Algae" title="Green Algae">Green Algae</a></li></ul>
<p>Villagers will reward the player with gold equivalent to three times the item's normal value, which may make Item Delivery quests a more efficient method of earning money from items than <a href="/Shipping" title="Shipping">shipping</a> them.  The player also earns 150 <a href="/Friendship" title="Friendship">Friendship</a> points with the requesting villager for completing the quest, with the exception of <a href="/Marriage#Divorce" title="Marriage">divorced spouses</a>.
</p><p>To complete an Item Delivery quest, the player must hand the item to the requestor. Simply having the item in inventory when talking to them will not complete the quest.  <i>Note that completing an Item Delivery quest does not count as giving them a <a href="/Friendship#Gifts" title="Friendship">gift</a>.</i>
</p><p>Note: <a href="/Jas" title="Jas">Jas</a>, <a href="/Vincent" title="Vincent">Vincent</a>, <a href="/Krobus" title="Krobus">Krobus</a>, the <a href="/Dwarf" title="Dwarf">Dwarf</a>, and the player's spouse will never make Delivery requests. <a href="/Sandy" title="Sandy">Sandy</a> will make Delivery requests once the player has unlocked <a href="/The_Desert" title="The Desert">the Desert</a>. If the player has not yet met a villager that villager will not request any items. The chances of an "Item Delivery" quest being available do not increase as the player meets more villagers.

<p>In addition to quests posted on the "Help Wanted" board, there are several Story Quests unlocked during gameplay.  There is no penalty for accepting a Story Quest involving item delivery and then deleting it from the player's journal without completing it.  Story Quests do not count towards the "Gofer" or "A Big Help" <a href="/Achievements" title="Achievements">Achievements</a>.
</p><p><i>Note that the game adds 255 <a href="/Friendship" title="Friendship">Friendship</a> points for quests that say "1 <a href="/Friendship" title="Friendship">Friendship</a> heart", rather than exactly 250 points.</i>

<p>During a cutscene that is available starting on <a href="/Fall" title="Fall">Fall</a> 2, Year 1, regardless of the weather, a special orders board is installed in front of the <a href="/Mayor%27s_Manor" title="Mayor's Manor">Mayor's Manor</a>. This board has larger orders that would not be normally found on the Help Wanted board. Unlike Help Wanted requests, these orders are automatically filled without speaking to the requestor. Additionally, the special orders cannot be cancelled from the individual player quest listing, and time must be allowed to run out. Unless specified, the resources needed for special orders must be collected after the special order has been accepted. On orders that require the player to place items in a container, resources collected before the quest was accepted may be placed in said container, however, new resources must still be obtained. For example, 24 pre-acquired eggs may be placed in the Saloon fridge, but 24 more eggs must still be harvested afterwards to complete the order.
</p><p>New special orders become available on Monday. The maximum timeframe for a special order, if it is accepted on the day it is posted, varies from 7 to 28 days, depending on the special order. However, the allotted time for a special order decreases every day regardless of whether it has been accepted by the player or not. Hence, if the player starts a special order with a maximum timeframe of 7 days on Wednesday, the time given for completion will only be 5 days. If the player starts a special order with a maximum timeframe of 28 days on the 15th day of a month, they will be given only 14 days to complete the order. The table below indicates maximum timeframes.
</p><p>A new special order can be accepted each week, even if another one is still ongoing; multiple special orders can be active at the same time. 
</p><p>When doing a special order that requires shipping items, the player can ship the remaining items on the final day. The progress bar only tracks items shipped on previous days and this can create the impression that items shipped need to be shipped before the last day, but they do not.
</p><p>The table below states whether special orders are repeatable after having been successfully completed. All special orders will show up again if attempted and failed.
</p><p>If the player partially completes a special order but ultimately fails, the donated goods can be picked up in the Lost and Found box in <a href="/Mayor%27s_Manor" title="Mayor's Manor">the Mayor's house</a>.
</p><p>After completing a special order, the player can collect a <a href="/Prize_Ticket" title="Prize Ticket">Prize Ticket</a> from the box next to the special order board.  Special orders that have been completed will display a checkmark below the timeframe if they show up on the board again, allowing players to see what orders they have already fulfilled.

<ul><li>To fulfill Pierre's Prime Produce special order, you must harvest 25 gold-quality vegetables and you must place 25 gold-quality vegetables in Pierre's special bin. The shipped vegetables need not be the same items as the harvested ones, nor the same type of vegetables, nor all of matching types, nor even vegetables from the same season. All that matters is that you have counts of 25 harvests and 25 shipped.</li>

<li>If you complete Jodi's Request and talk to <a href="/Vincent" title="Vincent">Vincent</a> the same day, <a href="/Jodi" title="Jodi">Jodi</a> will say that it will be useful for her yellow curry, and <a href="/Vincent" title="Vincent">Vincent</a> might say "Eww... it's boiled beet again."</li>

<li>A divorced spouse may make a "Help Wanted" request. When fulfilling the quest, the spouse will express gratitude before going back to the angry/hurt dialogue.
