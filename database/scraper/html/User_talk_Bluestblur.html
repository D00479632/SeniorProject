<p>Hi, I just saw you upload the racer images for Desert Festival, I was wondering how did you get them? I've used StardewXnbHack but then the images are only 16x16 inside a larger file, yours are 48x48 px. Thanks! :) <a href="/User:YuvixAdun" title="User:YuvixAdun">YuvixAdun</a> (<a href="/User_talk:YuvixAdun" title="User talk:YuvixAdun">talk</a>) 04:30, 5 April 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hey! I have no idea if this is the most efficient way, but this is my process for getting sprites: (1) Use StardewXnbHack to unpack the Content folder. (2) Find relevant sprite sheets from LooseSprites, TileSheets, or a few other places. (3) Use <a class="external free" href="https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter" rel="nofollow">https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter</a> to cut the sprite sheet, usually into 16x16 images. If it's a big sprite sheet, then I'll crop it smaller first. (4) Download each small sprite and upload them into <a class="external free" href="https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/" rel="nofollow">https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/</a>, resizing them by 300% (so they become 48x48). I hope that was helpful! <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 04:36, 5 April 2024 (UTC)

<p>Hey I was wondering if you could please help me with the trash catalogue png. I myself don't unpack images from the game files. I just use a website that has the images, but the trash catalogue icon image on the website is no good either. I was wondering if there was any way you could upload a correctly sized png of the trash catalogue icon. Its messing up the graphs in furniture and giving me a hard time trying to correctly size them. Ps. I know for a fact that the image has to be at least 48px by 48px if that helps. <a href="/User:Emily_Romano" title="User:Emily Romano">Emily Romano</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Emily_Romano" title="User talk:Emily Romano">talk</a>) 01:31, 17 April 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hey! I'd be glad to help. I've noticed you've been hard at work with all the furniture changes, which is great! Give me one sec, and I should be able to upload a properly sized image. <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 01:34, 17 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Oh my gosh you're amazing, and thanks for the acknowledgement. I have been trying so hard lately because I want everyone to be able to see the new furniture options. That way they are able to start planning their houses if they want to. I myself am a mobile user, but I already got my 1.6 house all planned out. <a href="/User:Emily_Romano" title="User:Emily Romano">Emily Romano</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Emily_Romano" title="User talk:Emily Romano">talk</a>) 01:37, 17 April 2024 (UTC)
</p><p>Ps. Hey there again, sorry to bother you but I think the trash catalogue png needs to have the see through sides of it cut off, like the other catalogue pngs. This is the reason it is not formating correctly, when sized. <a href="/User:Emily_Romano" title="User:Emily Romano">Emily Romano</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Emily_Romano" title="User talk:Emily Romano">talk</a>) 01:42, 17 April 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>No worries, you're not bothering me! I did cut off the sides when cropping the image, and I have no idea why it looks so squished right now lol. I think it sometimes takes a bit before image changes actually appear on the wiki, so let's wait and see. If it doesn't work, then I can try again. <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 01:47, 17 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Hey there, I don't know if you wanna give that trash catalogue png another try, but it would be much appreciated. Thank you for all your help. <a href="/User:Emily_Romano" title="User:Emily Romano">Emily Romano</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Emily_Romano" title="User talk:Emily Romano">talk</a>) 03:02, 17 April 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I just cropped it again, but it looks exactly the same as the first file I uploaded. Also, weirdly enough, clicking on the 'new' image thumbnail on the file page still takes me to the previous image, so perhaps my image hasn't been fully processed yet? Let's give it a little more time - hopefully it doesn't look weird by tomorrow. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, I know it looks really odd right now! <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 03:12, 17 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Thats ok, thanks for trying again though.

</p><p>Last thing, do you know how to update the sections at the bottom of the furniture page. The part that has the categories and all links to the items within them? I'd like to start working on that but I have no idea how to get the 1.6 furniture links to pop up. <a href="/User:Emily_Romano" title="User:Emily Romano">Emily Romano</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Emily_Romano" title="User talk:Emily Romano">talk</a>) 03:21, 17 April 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Those big sections at the bottom of the page are called "navboxes", and you can find the specific furniture navbox here: <a href="/Template:NavboxFurniture" title="Template:NavboxFurniture">Template:NavboxFurniture</a> <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 03:27, 17 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>No problem! Good luck with adding all the new furniture links to that navbox! <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 03:36, 17 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="Hi_again,_Help_Requested"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Hi_again.2C_Help_Requested">Hi again, Help Requested</span></h2>
<p>Hey there, hope you are doing good. I have finally got all the 1.6 furnture onto the English furniture page. Except 3 little pesky items: Decorative Walnut Ladder, Decorative Oak Ladder, and the Decorative Hatch. I haven't been able to upload the 3 items because I don't know what they are. Such as a decoration, a floor piece or something that hangs on the wall. I was wondering if the data you use might know? I would love to get these last little items up and linked. <a href="/User:Emily_Romano" title="User:Emily Romano">Emily Romano</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Emily_Romano" title="User talk:Emily Romano">talk</a>) 00:11, 19 April 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hey! The Decorative Walnut Ladder and Decorative Oak Ladder are considered "paintings" since they attach to the wall. I'd say they can go into the "Wall Hangings" category. The Decorative Hatch is considered "decor", so perhaps it could go with the "Small Decorations"? I hope that helps! I can also resize the two ladder images in a bit. <a href="/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:40, 19 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

That's why I decided to translate wiki pages into Arabic
My question is, is that possible?

<p>I know now!Sir Bluestblur is right.the <a href="/Skull_Cavern#Treasure_Roomsn" title="Skull Cavern">Skull Cavern</a> page says the following"All percent chances listed below are assuming that the player has claimed Farming Mastery (for the Golden Animal Cracker) and Combat Mastery (for the Trinkets). If either or both have not been claimed, then the chances for all other available items are slightly increased."
</p><p>That means percent chances of individual pages are calculated according to the latter case.
</p><p>So,no need change individual pages.I apologize.<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:%E9%AA%91%E5%87%A4%E6%95%A3%E4%BA%BA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:骑凤散人 (page does not exist)">骑凤散人</a> (<a href="/User_talk:%E9%AA%91%E5%87%A4%E6%95%A3%E4%BA%BA" title="User talk:骑凤散人">talk</a>) 07:42, 16 August 2024 (UTC)
