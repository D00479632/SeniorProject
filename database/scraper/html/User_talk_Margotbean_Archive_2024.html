<h2><span id="Most_Helpful_Contribution_(Especially_From_New_Editors)"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Most_Helpful_Contribution_.28Especially_From_New_Editors.29">Most Helpful Contribution (Especially From New Editors)</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I’ve been checking out the recent changes page every so often for a while now in anticipation of the new release and it’s clear that you have a lot on your hands. The “Help Editing” page doesn’t give any pointers towards the kind of changes that would be most helpful to you and the wiki, so <b>(a)</b> I was wondering if you had any in mind (or if there’s a “wanted tasks” list that I missed!)
</p><p>Two more related questions - 
</p><p><b>(b)</b> if a user spots vandalism before you get to it, do you prefer that they leave it to you or revert the change?
</p><p><b>(c)</b> the “help editing” page says that changes in formatting should be applied across all languages. What exactly does that encompass? I assume new information can be added to only one language, but what about adding a new section to an article?
</p><p>And finally, one question that is only partially related - <b>(d)</b> do you think it could be worth adding a note to Emily’s page explaining why Clint isn’t one of her friends, as this seems to be a common cause of confusion and incorrect edits? I’m sure this is on her talk page but it may be worth adding to the actual page for those users who only read the wiki. --<a href="/User:Gravy" title="User:Gravy">Gravy</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gravy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Gravy (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:27, 2 January 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello Gravy! I haven't had a "help wanted" list since v1.3, so, no, there's nothing I can point you to. After v1.6 releases, it's going to be a free-for-all, so knock yourself out then (so to speak). :D</dd>
<dd>You should clean up vandalism if you see it. If a vandal has made several changes to a page, that involves hitting the "undo" link multiple times, starting with the most recent change, and working backwards. It's time-consuming and can be confusing looking through the version history list, but that's the best way to ensure information isn't changed or lost in the process. If I come along later and see something has changed, I may revert the cleanup and then revert the vandalism, because I have access to more powerful links to do so. You should <i>not</i> take it personally! I appreciate vandalism clean-up!</dd>
<dd>Changes to existing formatting require discussion, adding a new section (if it's substantial) should also be discussed. When version 1.6 is released, new information will be added without discussing formatting, as people discover it. New pages and sections will be added, and no one is expected to add them to all 12 languages. But until then, formatting changes encompass everything on the wiki.</dd>
<dd>As for Emily and Clint, they may well be friends after v1.6 is released. There is new dialogue being added, so we may (or may not) see more of their relationship being revealed. I don't know. The basis for "friendship" was always "if they give a gifting hint, they're friends, otherwise not." But I added <a href="/Friendship#Gift_Preference_Dialogues" title="Friendship">a table</a> for that and removed the field from the infobox on each villager's page, so their friendship is subjective and open to interpretation now. I don't think we need to take action until after v1.6 is released.</dd>
<dd>I'll update <a href="/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> to reflect that some of the "rules" don't apply to version 1.6 as well.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fertilizer">Fertilizer</span></h2>
<p>I'm glad I found an acceptable edit for my recent findings about Deluxe Retaining Soil. Since then, I've continued some investigations and think I may have more to distribute across various articles on the subject, but I'm not likely to find a way to make those edits that wouldn't be disruptive in the context of the v1.6 release, so I will be holding off. I also need to formulate just what it is I ought to say, so I have no material to look at right away. And I hear that v1.6 may be close? So, just a heads up that something's pending with me, and it might affect structures within somewhat (not sure). I do find there's not much said about fallow but tillable soil, and that whole subject does have implications for fertilizer, so I've got to look around and find where that belongs. All the best for v1.6! <a href="/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 20:43, 13 February 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Thanks for the heads up! You may find that I'm so frazzled, I don't care what you change... (Don't tell anyone, though!)</dd>
<dd>I don't know how close v1.6 is, there are a fair few bugs to be fixed, but when it's released you might find some things have changed with regard to fertilizer. The alpha change notes (<a href="/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.6#Vanilla_release_notes" title="Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6">Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6#Vanilla release notes</a>) already contain a change to tilled soil underneath <a href="/Crafting#Seeds" title="Crafting">seasonal Wild Seeds</a> on Ginger Island, so if you're going to deal with those type of seeds, there may be even more changes with v1.6. You may find a bug specific to v1.6 as well, although I hope not.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, thanks again for the heads up. Please proceed with your project, and have fun! <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 23:00, 14 February 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>And thanks for the v1.6 heads up, too. I think now that the best approach won't end up changing article structures much: perhaps a new section, once, mostly paragraphs and/or sentences. So that doesn't look too serious. "V1.6 close" is what I've been hearing since November, so I think I won't wait. Who knows when it will be, really? A Wild Seeds change sounds like a special case wrt the stuff I've been digging up - a detail, not a basic behavior.

<h2><span id="Enforcing_Rules_that_don't_exist"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Enforcing_Rules_that_don.27t_exist">Enforcing Rules that don't exist</span></h2>
<p>Something strange has caught my attention in my two days of being on the Stardew Valley wiki. Every single edit of mine has been deleted or reversed. Strange?... I look at the revision history of all the changes I have made, and something strange sticks out to me. All of the changes done by you? What a coincidence! So my intuition tells me that "maybe I'm breaking some sort of rule?". So I go onto the "help page" but when I scroll down to read it I don't see a single rule stating that what I did was wrong? 
</p><p>Here are some of the rules I have "broken"..
</p>
<ul><li>as both a Console and PC player, I noticed that some features available on PC are not available to be accessed on Console (e.g., Some Profile Easter eggs like clicking on Haley's picture) . So, to be helpful, I added a little bit of info, so console players don't get stuck trying to do something that they can't do. And no, it's not a bug. You physically cannot click on the pictures for a reason. It would be frustrating if, instead of scrolling through two options (scroll left, scroll right), there was a middle option that didn't do anything useful other than waste your time.</li>
<li>the glitches page: You had a discussion? No, you didn't. I can see past logs. You know that, right? You came to an agreement with yourself that that page shouldn't exist. Adding onto that, your original gripe with the first version of the page was that it was dedicated to a single glitch. My new page was devoted to a plethora of glitches not jus the single one you had a problem with.</li>
<li>Guys can get pregnant. Yeah, you heard that? Not every person who sets their farmer to male has a pair of testicles. If I were a trans guy, I think I would like to know if my farmer is getting pregnant or my spouse or if I had an option.</li>
<li>I literally uses the exact same format as the other info on the heart event page.</li></ul>
<p>Honestly I feel like It would make everybody's life's easier if we had an actual formatting rules page instead a single page that doesn't really say mutch.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="1.6_Release_Date">1.6 Release Date</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I have two quick questions - 1) concernedape's twitter seems to say v1.6 will be released on the 19th, but in your above reply you said 21st. Did I miss something somewhere? (just wanted to make sure both for myself and in case you accidentally had the wrong date down!) 2) is it worth adding the release date to the main page? I know this is something you would have to do and it's only two weeks away, so it may not be, but not everyone has an X/twitter account and seeing the announcement tweet is difficult without it for some reason (I had to follow a link from an article to see it). <a href="/User:Gravy" title="User:Gravy">Gravy</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gravy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Gravy (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:22, 3 March 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting_Ingredients">Crafting Ingredients</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your message. I didn't realize 1.6 was coming out so soon or I probably would have waited. And I also didn't realize big changes have to be approved first. Yes, I found the cooking ingredients so helpful on that page that I copied that format. One reason I think my format is better than a short list as in your example is I find it very helpful to have the items divided by category and with their seasons specified. Then I know that in Spring I need to get certain crops, for example, or these are all the things I need to get from the mines. And there's a precedent for that format, and also for having it on the same page, on the cooking page as you mentioned. If I were going to put those ingredients on a separate page, then I think the cooking ingredients should also be moved to a separate page for consistency. Shouldn't those two pages be consistent? I know that my longer format is a tremendous amount of work (and it was) which is probably why it hadn't been done before, but other than it almost being out-of-date, since someone's done it, could the update stand once I've edited it for 1.6? Thanks for your appreciation, btw. I made a similar update on the RSV wiki for a lot of information that was missing on the quests page and my changes were reverted without any message or explanation. Never played RSV again, lol. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Susb8383&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Susb8383 (page does not exist)">Susb8383</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Susb8383" title="User talk:Susb8383">talk</a>) 21:16, 17 March 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Yes, yes, and yes. Oh, and I'm sorry about the RSV wiki!</dd>
<dd>Yes, your longer format is fine if you feel it's helpful, and yes, we can build the tables once v1.6 is released. I would strongly prefer a link to the page, so that the page would be "Crafting/Ingredients" (a sub-page of Crafting) and then a simple link to it under a heading "Ingredients".</dd>
<dd>And yes, the <a href="/Cooking" title="Cooking">Cooking</a> page should be the same! Unfortunately, there is only one of me, and 12 languages to try desperately to keep cohesive. With all the 1.6 changes (and all the daily changes across all 12 languages), moving ingredients to a separate page has been pushed to the bottom of the "to do" list. One of us could easily do it in English, but then what about the other languages? It's a relatively simple change, someone just has to find the correct translation for "see [this page]" and then move the section. It sounds straight-forward, but around language #6 you start to think "Wowsers, this is a lot of work, did I make a mistake in German, oh geez, I have to check that" and then you lose your place... Well, it gets complicated very fast. Having said that, if you want to attempt that change in all 12 languages, that would be stupendous. (!!)</dd>
<dd>Otherwise, we'll concentrate on <a href="/Crafting" title="Crafting">Crafting</a> for now, start creating the tables in 2 days, and then migrating the changes to the other languages will be part of v1.6 changes, more likely for translators to pick up and do themselves.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mossy_Seed_-_Tree_Variations">Mossy Seed - Tree Variations</span></h2>
<p>Hello, sorry in advance for the confusion but I have planted my mossy seed and saw it grow into a large all-green mossy tree, and went through the game's .xnb files and found the images for it. The tree was simply named tree 3 Green Rain, and when tapped it produced fiddlehead fern. I added this information to a Mossy Tree page, and another user alerted me that their mossy seed had grown into a different tree, which when they looked into the .xnb files for, they found under tree 1 Green rain. Their tree cannot be tapped like mine, but it spreads seeds around it (whereas I'm not sure mine does). Now we have these two confirmed (but separate) trees that grow from the same seed, with a possible third variant (the file tree 2 Green rain) coming from the mossy seed as well. It seems that these are called the Fiddlehead Stalk (tree 3 Green rain) and the Wild Tree (tree 1 Green rain), but I'm not sure how to validate the legitimacy of these names...? Right now the Fiddlehead Stalk is named under the Mossy Tree page, and I was wondering if there was a way to update it to a new name once one is confirmed, and also on how to proceed with formatting when 1 seed can produce many variants of a tree. Should it be three separate tree pages, or one page with all of them? Thank you so much for any guidance.
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello anonymous editor! The fact is, there is no in-game name for these trees, and I don't know what to call them to differentiate them from other trees that have moss on them. If we stick to the game files, then they are "Green Rain Trees". They all start with the green rain event.</dd>
<dd>I think we should discuss the proper name for them, and try (try!) to decide quickly, before the name gets copied into 11 other languages and becomes an indelible part of history. If we have already decided on "Mossy Tree" then we need to be explicit about the difference between a "Mossy Tree" and a tree with Moss on it. Because "Mossy Trees" come with and without moss on them. 🥴 <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 16:44, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Just chipping into this discussion, I agree that calling is Mossy Tree is a bit confusing with the other trees which can also have Moss on them. I think this name comes from the fact that these trees can be grown using <a href="/Mossy_Seed" title="Mossy Seed">Mossy Seed</a>, which is a bit of a misnomer since its not necessarily moss related. Perhaps 'Green Rain Trees' is the best we can do.<a href="/User:YuvixAdun" title="User:YuvixAdun">YuvixAdun</a> (<a href="/User_talk:YuvixAdun" title="User talk:YuvixAdun">talk</a>) 17:23, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Adding my bit since I've been helping do some research and editing for the Mossy Seed and Mossy Tree Wiki pages.  From what I've seen, The trees have been labelled as the Fiddlehead Stalk and the Wild Trees(as there are two of these variations) by the community.  The other editor and I were in the process of asking an admin(not sure who) how to handle formatting of a seed that produces 3 variations of tree, but the Mossy Tree wiki page seems to be no more.<a href="/User:Tmh" title="User:Tmh">Tmh</a> 3:08 PM, 23 March 2024 (CST)
<dl><dd>i was gonna suggest to name the new tree just "wild tree" as it's mentioned in both the mossy seed and mushroom log's descriptions (that log seems to work the best with these trees), but i'm not sure now since those other seed trees could also be considered "wild" 😅 <a href="/User:Sooji_gooji" title="User:Sooji gooji">Sooji gooji</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sooji_gooji&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Sooji gooji (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:30, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd><s>Hey, there's been a discussion <a href="/Talk:Green_Rain_Trees" title="Talk:Green Rain Trees">here</a> about various "Green Rain Tree" things, but I'll repeat my latest post there. "I'm just now realizing that the term "Mossy Tree" was removed and replaced with Green Rain Trees, but I personally believe that it should be reverted. I feel like that is what it should logically be called, and "Green Rain Trees" seems sort of weird, considering that they come from other sources besides that event. We can just put one of those notes at the top of the pages that says "Not to be confused with trees covered in moss.""

<dl><dd>Ok, quite a bit has happened. I feel that it should stay as "Green Rain Trees" so forget everything I said above. This is mainly because "Wild Trees" is a new concept that consists of all trees in the wild. Because of this, <b>Wild Tree</b> would need to be moved to a page called <b>Bushy Mossy Tree</b> and <b>Lush Wild Tree</b> needs to be moved to Leafy Mossy Tree. These Bushy and Leafy adjectives actually come from the game code so it’s official. This also means that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/Mossy_Tree" title="Mossy Tree">Mossy Tree</a> page can be changed to a “disambiguation page” (a list of what it may mean) of sorts. I can handle this, as long as you take the protection off that page, though. :) And don't worry-I'll make sure to add plenty of "Not to be confused with..." notices. I know this is a confusing topic, but I believe that this is the least confusing method.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="1.6_Fish_Code_changes">1.6 Fish Code changes</span></h2>
<p>As you may know, 1.6 changed the coding for special fish spawns (e.g. Legendary fish, Night Market fish, fishing presents, etc.). Pre-1.6, their spawns were taken care of in functions called getFish in the game code. However, for most of them, their spawns are now taken care of in Data\Locations.xnb. Upon inspection, very few (if any) of their percentage chances of catching have actually changed. Therefore, I will change all of the necessary getFish references to reference Data\Locations.xnb instead. Letting you know because these changes won't need history sections as nothing related to the actual gameplay changes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trying_new_template">Trying new template</span></h2><p>
Hi Margotbean, I want to try and add a new template to make it easier to include a reference to a specific mastery, like </p><pre>{{Mastery|Farming}}</pre><p> which would then generate an icon and a link to the mastery page.

<h2><span id="Inventory,_Tabs,_Player_Menu"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Inventory.2C_Tabs.2C_Player_Menu">Inventory, Tabs, Player Menu</span></h2>
<p>I'm confused about the use of terminology and the organization of the Wiki regarding matters intersecting these items. "Inventory" has long meant the first tab of (the Player Menu?, or what?), and its page seems to indicate that it's just the first tab. But I'm not sure we're consistent about using "inventory" in that way. We have separate articles for other tabs, some of those new, but where do we describe what a "Tab" really is and where to find it? Inventory? We seem to have no article that draws all the tabs together (no "Player Menu"), to describe such a central UI feature. And isn't "Player Menu" often used as inventory? I think it's all a bit jumbled, and the website lacks sufficient topical articles to help sort out distinctions and separations from unions and conjunctions. Now is as good a time as any to put any changes into practice.
</p><p>One more element to this: Mastery. The Mastery Tab displays just the Powers of the masteries, not all the effects of them. The <a href="/Mastery_Cave" title="Mastery Cave">Mastery Cave</a> article certainly could be used to put all mastery features together, but that would probably mean listing the powers there as well, introducing replication, yet the tab needs the info also.
</p><p>So I'm asking for guidance on how the Wiki should be structured, for all of us. But I'm also asking for terminology intent, that the texts may be clear. It's certainly a bundle!
</p><p>There's also a little matter of how the player is supposed to be able to track progress towards the next mastery level in-game, when the Mastery Tab doesn't seem to give that information. I've got that on <a href="/Talk:Mastery_Cave" title="Talk:Mastery Cave">Talk:Mastery Cave</a> too, but if you know...  Thanks for your patience! <a href="/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 02:08, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I can address some of that! The player menu refers to the entire set of tabs that pops up in-game when you hit "E" or "Esc" by default. The player tab is the 2nd tab from the left on that menu, right after the inventory tab. It does introduce difficulty, since both terms use "player". But the two are different! Some places refer to it as the "Skills Tab" as well, which isn't awful, but outdated.</dd>
<dd>When I get the chance to breathe, I can make more wiki changes. <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 16:43, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks! The more I look at it, the more I'm inclined towards the idea of a Player Menu article. I could write up a good intro right now, starting with the clarifications you just gave me. It would need an image - of the default display when it pops up. But that's essentially the "Inventory Screen" section of <a href="/Inventory" title="Inventory">Inventory</a> right now, which needs updating anyway. Splitting off that part of Inventory would lead to two short articles, true, but it would also make distinct the shift between global and local foci of topics and emphasize where all the many tab articles are centered. Just a thought. <a href="/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 18:24, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Second thought, in place of the original above. Perhaps Player Menu could be a name redirect in the article space - to <a href="/Inventory" title="Inventory">Inventory</a>. Inventory is the way it pops up, and separate sections could be devoted to the two purposes, with the need for only one image to oversee all, and wording to avoid duplications. <a href="/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 23:15, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi, just made this account to make some edits but realized too late I didn't add an "x" to the end of my username to make it "Gofer2x". It's my usual username and I'd prefer to keep it consistent across sites. I've looked online and Mediawiki seems to let admins change usernames, could you change it for me if not a problem? 
</p><p>Also, I want to dig through the code and add some references to some wiki pages. But if the relevant code is in a bigger function (like several hundred lines long), do I only point to the function or add extra details (e.g. <samp>Foo.Bar::Baz</samp>, <samp>case 35</samp>? I imagine a line number could also work but it could differ across setups.
</p>
<dl><dd>I'm sorry, I'm unable to change usernames.</dd>
<dd>When giving code references, how specific you want to get is up to you. I wouldn't add line numbers or case numbers, because decompilers can change those. But adding something simple like "the use case for 'nameOfCase'" would be fine.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Redirects">Redirects</span></h2>
<p>I've been adding some redirects to the wiki and you've been deleting them. Personally, I think the redirects provide a tremendous amount of value. However, since you've been deleting them, presumably you think they are just clutter and/or not necessary. Would you allow me to possibly convince you otherwise? As a basic example, take the case of "book seller". If I type that into the wiki, it currently <a class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/a/fDK1KVo" rel="nofollow">looks like this</a>, giving 0 results and giving the appearance that such a thing does not exist on the wiki at all. However, of course that is a lie, because the page "Bookseller" exists. This is confusing because in normal English, "book seller" is always separated as two words. The only reason that it is different on the wiki is because ConcernedApe made a typo / grammatical error when implementing it into the game, and the wiki explicitly follows the in-game conventions.
</p><p>You could imagine a scenario with a user being something along the lines of: "Oh, the Book Seller is in town today. I remember from last time that they sell rare books, but I don't remember anymore which specific ones that are sold. No problem, let me look that up on the wiki! [types in "book seller", gets no results]. What the heck? I guess the wiki doesn't have any information on the book seller yet, so let me just do a Google search for "stardew book seller" and see what I can find. [does Google search] Wait a second, the Google search just pointed me back to the wiki. Oh, I see the problem now, bookseller is one word on the wiki. That's really annoying!"
</p><p>We can fix up this user story with a redirect. By making "book seller" redirect to "bookseller", we can plant users exactly where they expect to be with 0 friction. Perhaps we could call these type of redirects "search redirects", which have the explicit goal of saving the user time or preventing a second click and/or a second google search. Unfortunately, I know that such "search redirects" will show up in the MediaWiki admin tools as "orphaned pages" that don't link anywhere else, which will make them show up alongside other legitimate pages that do need to be deleted. However, I think that search redirects provide so much value that they should be excepted. Please consider this request. --<a href="/User:Zamiel" title="User:Zamiel">Zamiel</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Zamiel" title="User talk:Zamiel">talk</a>) 10:14, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi, to your specific mention of "Bookseller" - the word <i>does</i> exist in English; it is a noun that is defined as the proprietor of a bookstore or one who sells books. (<a class="external free" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bookseller" rel="nofollow">https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bookseller</a>) ConcernedApe did NOT make a typo or grammatical error.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>So, while redirects might be useful in some circumstances, for this one, it is moot. <a href="/User:Rogue.toast" title="User:Rogue.toast">Rogue.toast</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Rogue.toast" title="User talk:Rogue.toast">talk</a>) 21:01, 3 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>My inquiry is not just about bookseller. It is about "search redirects" more generally. Search redirects provide value regardless of whether or not the word exists in a dictionary. I could come up with some equally compelling example that does not exist in the dictionary. e.g. Joja Mart --&gt; JojaMart --<a href="/User:Zamiel" title="User:Zamiel">Zamiel</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Zamiel" title="User talk:Zamiel">talk</a>) 23:48, 3 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="GiftHeader_displays_outdated_info">GiftHeader displays outdated info</span></h2>
<p>hi boss<br/>as of 1.6, several villagers have new dialogue when given gifts on their birthday (Jas, Vincent, Penny, Shane, Lewis...). the GiftHeader tag does not account for this and still shows the old generic dialogue. i assumed the most elegant solution was to simply remove the GiftHeader tag and manually write in the info it displays, including the new dialogue, but I've been shouted at for attempting this. will GiftHeader be updated to account for the new dialogue?
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello DrDean (remember to sign posts with 4 tiles, plz!), sorry for the shouty caps. The answer to your question really depends on whether or not someone wants to update the template in all 12 languages. Today is the first day I'm able to access the wiki without errors since v1.6 released, so I can tentatively start to make template changes, but there are several (<b>several</b>) changes to be made. So, do you know what a switch/case is? Do you have any interest in changing the template in all 12 languages? <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:06, 11 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>it's alright, i understand the frustration. this is my point though - it seems like more hassle than it's worth to update the template to account for every edge case. unfortunately i'm monolingual and have a very loose understanding of wiki formatting so i won't be much help with it. perhaps the part of GiftHeader that contains birthday dialogue could be removed, and each villager's page could have their respective birthday dialogue written in manually? so it would look like ==Gifts==, then {{GiftHeader}}, then 'For loved or liked gifts, Jas will say...' etc. i would happily do this for the English wiki but unfortunately i won't be much help for any of the translations. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">DrDeanDingleman</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:48, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It might be better that way, but that would still require changes to the template (in all 12 languages). <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:37, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>i could do that then, with your permission? i suppose i don't need to understand the language to remove info. this would leave the non-English wikis without any birthday dialogue for a while until a proper translator wrote it in, but if you're okay with that i can go ahead and change the template(s). <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">DrDeanDingleman</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:33, 20 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>NO. The translations are in data files and must be added to the template.

<dl><dd>Would it be helpful in the meantime to collect the custom birthday dialog for each language? I don't know how to access data files, but anyone can copy it down by switching the language in-game, as long as they know enough about the language to write it accurately using a keyboard (if it doesn't use a latin alphabet). That way when someone is able to make the changes to the template, they will already have most of the missing data. <a href="/User:Scarecrow" title="User:Scarecrow">Scarecrow</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Scarecrow&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Scarecrow (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:55, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flooring_Images_and_Icons">Flooring Images and Icons</span></h2>
<p>Hey, thought I should let you know that you missed the majority of new Flooring options added in 1.6. 32 regular, numbered flooring options were added in 1.6 (in "walls_and_floors.xnb"), in addition to the 9 "MoreFloors:X" floors. I'd address the issue myself, but I'm not sure exactly how you were extracting item icons from the game, given I was unable to find anything other the actual floor textures. These 32 numbered floors are all available from the regular catalogue, between (FL)55 (the pink love hearts one, old highest index floor) and MoreFloors:0 (the new dark wood planks). This also messes up the indexing for floor images, which might require admin powers to fix. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Sicarious&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Sicarious (page does not exist)">Sicarious</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Sicarious" title="User talk:Sicarious">talk</a>) 13:43, 18 April 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thanks for responding! I just tried to test this out on 1.5.6, but every time I passed out, I was found by someone other than Marlon. I was using an old save file that was still in version 1.5.6, and played around 13 days. I'm not sure why I couldn't get Marlon. Maybe I wasn't progressed far enough in the game? (the old save file is in Fall Year 1, but the adventurer's guild is open so I thought it would work). I would be happy to do more testing if I could get my hands on a 1.5.6 save file that is progressed further to eliminate that possibility. It could be the case that Marlon only finds you if you pass out in Skull Cavern.

<p>Hi,
I wonder if you could tell me why my changes I made to the Cherry page are gone?
</p><p>I added a reference to needing dried cherries for the raccoon request. This is helpful if you're trying to decided whether you need a cherry tree or not. I didn't get one because I had already shipped a cherry from my fruit cave and knew it wasn't needed in any recipes. Then I got the raccoon's request for dried cherries which means I needed five and had to buy a sapling and wait.
</p><p>That's info that someone looking up cherries would want to know.
</p><p>Can you tell me why my changes didn't stick?

Item 170 (Broken Glasses) and category forage_item_beach are listed in liked items in <samp>NPCGiftTastes.xnb</samp>, and their quotes are in Evelyn's dialogue file.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Holy_Blade_Spawn">Holy Blade Spawn</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean! I have never edited a page like this before so I really hope I am doing it correctly! But I discovered some information about the Holy Blade and figured y'all would want to know! I just got two holy blades during a mine run and both of them spawned from defeating special (star antennae) black slimes! Unfortunately, I did not get the floor numbers but one floor was an all green monster room and the other was a normal round room. Both were in the lava, purple earth sections, roughly floors 85-95. Obviously, I don't know if this was pure coincidence or if it is an actual spawn requirement, but I figured it couldn't hurt to share since the wiki page for the Holy Blade is fairly limited.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cabin_Locations_Image_Upload">Cabin Locations Image Upload</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean! I think I messed up something about images, again. I uploaded <b>File:1.6 4p meadow close.png</b> and <b>File:1.6 4p meadow separate.png</b>, but now I see that according to other 4 player cabin location images, that "4p" shouldn't be there in the image name. I thought I can move it but I forgot that I can't do it in English wiki, lol. Can you move them please, and sorry about this. I want to put them in all language wikis -that has that page-. Thank you.<a href="/User:Peaw" title="User:Peaw">Peaw</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Peaw" title="User talk:Peaw">talk</a>) 14:16, 25 June 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Sure, I can move the files, but what should the new name be? The other images end in "8p" because they show 8 cabins for 8 players. Don't your images show 4 players? Please advise! Thanks, <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:53, 25 June 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Other images for 4 players are named with this format: <code>File:&lt;version&gt;_&lt;farmtype&gt;_close.png</code> or <code>File:&lt;version&gt;_&lt;farmtype&gt;_far.png</code>. The "8p" text only takes part in 8 player images, and 4 player images don't have a "4p" text. <code>separate</code> is for 8 players, and 4 players images use <code>far</code>. So I'd suggest just removing the "4p" part (and change "seperate" in second image) from these images and rename them as <code>1.6 meadow close.png</code> and <code>1.6 meadow far.png</code>.

<dl><dd>Hi Emily, unfortunately I haven't had the time to clean up the furniture page following your last round of edits, so I'm going to have to say no to this project idea from you right now.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hi there Margotbean, I think that the furniture page looks absolutely amazing but I am sincerely sorry if you don't like it. I really thought I helped.

<dl><dd>Hi Emily, I know you had the best of intentions, and your work was a big help! It really was! But I do feel like the formatting needs to be fixed on the furniture page. The wiki community pitched in and fixed some of the issues, but there is still some amount of cleanup that needs to be done.</dd>
<dd>As far as today's edits, you made changes to a template without discussion, created redlinks on a page, and <i>then</i> started a discussion about it. So, it all comes down to a basic lack of experience, <b>and</b> perhaps you never read <a href="/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>. So, my decision remains "no" for the Cask Productivity edits. I think that playing on mobile is also a bit of a disadvantage for you, since you don't have the 1.6 update. I'm not going to forbid you from making edits, I have no reason to do so. But please read <a href="/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> before considering larger projects, and please start a discussion before making them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Deletion_of_Useful_Personal_Page">Deletion of Useful Personal Page</span></h2>
<p>Hi there, apparently it is against terms to have personal pages? I think this page that was deleted (User:Zamiel/Gold_to_Energy_Ratios) was very prolific within the min/max speedrun community. Can this just be restored as an actual page? I had only just found it and it was extremely useful as I was learning to min/max the game and there are many links to it via speedrun websites and forums. Please reconsider the removal. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Uber2a&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Uber2a (page does not exist)">Uber2a</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Uber2a&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Uber2a (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:16, 19 July 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I'm sorry Uber, but Zamiel had advanced notice of the deletion, and seems not to have made an effort to move the data elsewhere. Traffic on the wiki makes editing impossible at times, and even affects read access, making it slower than it should be. Guides that aren't used or even referred to on the wiki, but are linked to from "many other sites" are one of the culprits. There is a section on the official forums for guides and resources, and I suggested it be moved there. But, again, Zamiel had plenty of time to copy/paste the data to a google spreadsheet, github program, etc. and failed to do so. (The pages also hadn't been updated in over a year.) So, they were deleted.</dd>
<dd>I was able to find an archive of the main page from the old wiki: <a class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220103173825/https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/User:Zamiel/Gold_to_Energy_Ratios" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20220103173825/https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/User:Zamiel/Gold_to_Energy_Ratios</a></dd>
<dd>This info could have easily been exported or copied to a google spreadsheet, so Zamiel is the one you need to chastise. No, go and create a github repo or a simple spreadsheet and distribute the link to that! —<a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 08:46, 20 July 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hey there! I recently tried to add more tips to the Qi's Prismatic Grange quest with common items that don't need to be purchased. You reverted this change stating that the tips are only good for players with a lot of cash(?) and that the ones I added depended on playstyle, so I assumed the issue was with how the tips were presented. I rewrote them to clearly distinguish between purchasable items and common/easy to gather items, and you reverted that too with a message saying that the quests page is not a replacement for the dyeing page, which lists all possible items that can be used for this quest.
</p><p>I'm very unclear on which kinds of tips are fine and which aren't. I felt like my changes were good because:
</p>

<dl><dd>Hello Variant9! It may have been accidental caps lock, it may have been the summer heat, it may have been that I <b>reverted the edit once already</b>, I don't know. I can't tell you which potential future hints are ok and which are not, but I can say the edit in question is a no-go. You claim that the items you listed are easy to obtain, but <i>again</i>, this depends solely on playstyle, with players who accept the quest while not in summer having difficult access to blueberries, players who've recently completed the sticky bundle being fresh out of sap, players who regularly turn ore into bars not having large amounts of ore laying around, etc. etc. etc. There are more reasons an item wouldn't be readily available than there are items on the <a href="/Dyeing" title="Dyeing">Dyeing</a> page. So, best advice, don't commit an edit a second time if it's been reverted once.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fall_leaves_losing">Fall leaves losing</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean!
</p><p>In the "<a href="/Version_History" title="Version History">Version History</a>" for 1.6, there is a note stating that "Some trees have a chance to lose their leaves in the fall." However, in-game, the actual implementation is that oak and maple trees transform into Green Rain Trees type 1 and 2, respectively, and remain so until the next spring. This implies that during this period, the leafless trees cannot have tappers placed on them and do not drop seeds from their original tree types. I believe these changes go beyond simply "lose their leaves". Therefore, I would like to ask your opinion: Do you think these details should be added as "Bug" to the corresponding page? <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%AA%E7%86%BA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:第二个熺 (page does not exist)">第二个熺</a> (<a href="/User_talk:%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%AA%E7%86%BA" title="User talk:第二个熺">talk</a>) 12:26, 11 August 2024 (UTC)

I recently edited the deluxe scarecrow page to add a guide on where to place deluxe scarecrows for complete coverage on the forest farm, which got deleted saying "This is 2MB of unnecessary" - Would it be better if I did the same for every farm type?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour_of_the_Seed_Maker">Behaviour of the Seed Maker</span></h2>
<p>Hi there.
</p><p>I attempted a correction of the page <a href="/Seed_Maker" title="Seed Maker">Seed Maker</a>, based on the latest source I could find decompiled (external link omitted, since the wiki doesn't allow them), and available readily. I understand that this (v1.5.4) isn't the latest available version (v1.6.8 build 24119 for the steam platform, at the time of writing), and that changes have been allegedly made, between the two versions, to the code managing random events; so the edit I made cannot stay as-is.
</p><p>However, the behaviour from the seed maker in the current steam version (v1.6.8) is still 100% reproducible at a given time of a given day, so the information I added concerning the possibility to game the seed maker by "determining when it is best to put seeds in before reloading the game and doing it the optimal way" is still relevant. I do not have access to the code for the version 1.6.8, so I cannot show the source code to justify this; however it is trivial to test in-game.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hello again, thanks for your answer. I am aware that DotNet applications can be de-compiled; I'm actually a developer (even if my goofy/obsessive behavior might have made me look childish; which is somewhat surprisingly a very common trait in developers, "amusingly" enough), and I know how to do this. However, I'm playing on the deck, which, as you likely know, doesn't run Microsoft Windows. I do not have a Microsoft Windows machine at all anymore (and yes, I know ILSpy works on "Linux", but it is still <i>more</i> work) and while I have the time to goof around on here (very light mental load), I do not have the time to do actual work (higher mental load) for free while I should actually do real work that pays. So, de-compiling the newer versions will have to wait until I have some free time I can allocate to technical tasks, or until someone else does it and uploads it somewhere online and indexed. On an unrelated note, I have written an entire new page for the Seed Maker discussion, detailing the code path and math behind the probabilities calculation, but I cannot create it because of the "New user mass edits protection" (which is a good thing to have, apparently, given a quick look at the moderation logs).

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I am also very confused. What does "a request cannot be prepared for ahead of time" mean?

<dd>Having said so much, I am curious about which content should be included in the "Quest" section, which content can be included, and which content cannot be included? Actually, I have encountered many problems while maintaining Wiki recently. If I have time later, I will list them all and ask for your opinion.</dd>
<dd>Maintaining 12 wikis simultaneously is undoubtedly a daunting task.

<dl><dd>Thank you, I try to do my best!</dd>
<dd>Basically, if the information helps a player complete a quest then it can be on the page. If the quest is random and requires a large number of items, then it's not helpful to have it on the page. Saving one potato for a "Help Wanted" quest is reasonable. Buying 100 potato seeds for a Special Order that may or may not happen is not reasonable, so there is not much point to having it on the page. It's the same for the raccoons and dried fruit, it's not reasonable to prepare a dried fruit for every fruit in the game, so there's no point in having it on the page. Fish Pond quests are pre-determined, that is to say, there are very few items that can be chosen, so it's reasonable to let players know they might want to save one of each item, just in case it's needed.</dd>
<dd>I can't say if every page on the wiki follows these guidelines right now, probably not. But I am still trying to get the wiki up-to-date from v1.6 while also preparing for v1.6.9. So, the inconsistencies will remain for now...</dd>
<dd>I usually say it will be fixed "within the next 7 years" because that's how long I worked on the wiki before v1.6. If you have specific questions, I will always try to answer them!

</p><p>I am currently trying to update the "Artisan Goods" section under the "Categories" section on the <a href="/Stardew_Valley_Fair" title="Stardew Valley Fair">Stardew Valley Fair</a> page, because the newly added <a href="/Dried_Fruit" title="Dried Fruit">Dried Fruit</a>, <a href="/Smoked_Fish" title="Smoked Fish">Smoked Fish</a>, etc. in 1.6 also have Category points but are not in the list. There are not many issues with updating dried fruits, but smoked fish has, as the price of smoked fish is simultaneously influenced by both Fishing(Fisher and Angler) and Artisan professions. I plan to add new columns to make the table suitable for smoked fish, and connect the icons of the two professions with a plus sign, just like the "Fruit" table. I would like to ask for your opinion first, as I have also noticed that there is currently no information related to smoked fish prices in the Infobox on various fish pages (but I think there should be, just like adding relevant Artisan Goods information to crops). I am not sure if the two are related. 
</p><p>In addition, there are now many types of items under the <a href="/Luau" title="Luau">Luau</a> page. Since the final response is related to the quality, base sell price, and edibility of the items, can we add a table to Luau like "Sell Price &amp; Quality" at the <a href="/Stardew_Valley_Fair" title="Stardew Valley Fair">Stardew Valley Fair</a> to help readers understand? <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%AA%E7%86%BA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:第二个熺 (page does not exist)">第二个熺</a> (<a href="/User_talk:%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%AA%E7%86%BA" title="User talk:第二个熺">talk</a>) 18:16, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

It's on the "to do" list!</dd>
<dd>The last time I looked at the code for the <a href="/Luau" title="Luau">Luau</a>, there were complex "if" statements that determine the governor's response, based on sell price and edibility.

<dl><dd>Well, I only noticed today that the table under "Categories" used templates... so forget about the change plan I mentioned earlier regarding smoked fish, which obviously didn't work. Besides, the table doesn't seem to be strictly arranged in alphabetical order, so I'm not sure where to add items like dried fruits. Maybe I need to rearrange the table in alphabetical order when adding new items? Or is the table arranged in some other way?</dd>
<dd>Regarding the plan to add a table to the <a href="/Luau" title="Luau">Luau</a> page, I'm putting it on hold for now, because as you said, it's not easy to create a table that simply expresses the final result based on the base price, quality, and edibility (moreover, we can't directly add edibility to the page, which is not displayed in the normal game, and it must first be converted into healing points).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Table_Sorting_for_Alphabetical_Order">Table Sorting for Alphabetical Order</span></h2>
<p>To take a tangent from the grange display discussion above, I would like to mention that the Wiki does not sort power book names strictly on the <a href="/Books" title="Books">Books</a> page. The problem is that several book names use "The" as the first word, and the sorter thus lists them under T's, while strict sorting rules omit consideration of initial "a", "an" and "the". I guess I find that annoying, so I bring it up because someone else might also. But it would seem that it may be worthy of thinking how many other tables might be adversely affected by the same thing, and to reconsider the alphabetization method. <a href="/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 21:00, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Mediawiki doesn't seem to provide for this problem, other than adding a <code>data-sort-value</code> to affected tables. In other circumstances, the name of the book would be listed like "Alleyway Buffet, The" but I don't think that would be a good solution here. Instead, you can just add data-sort-values to any affected table. <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 23:49, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks. That explains the table problem. I assume the code would be entered for each Description item in a table that needs to be sorted differently from the default? But not knowing anything about Mediawiki, I'd rather not mess with it. This is the "sort" of techno-fussiness I just don't have any remaining patience for.

<p>Hello margotbean!<br/>
I would like to copy and paste the Modding:Modder Guide into the Chinese wiki (the recent changes in the Chinese wiki you can see what I mean directly). By doing so it would be possible to fill in the missing pages in the guide. However, I also realized that you deleted some of those pages before, so I'm informing you of the changes that I will be made. At the same time, I am asking for your opinion about the changes.

<dl><dd>Hello Candybear! I have no problems with what you're doing. I can find only one page that I deleted, from an editor who made no other changes, because the page was formatted very badly and not translated.

<p>Hello, I was on the page of Pierre's store and I have noticed some things missing. Firstly, there was a typo that ommitted the word "been" in the "closed" section, which I added and submitted in the recent change, I also marked said edit as minor. However, there was some information missing regarding the version history, the editing guidelines said this sort of change was major and required discussion beforehand, especially considering that the new information needs to be translated to different languages. With this in mind, I am writing to you to propose the changes I want to make. I think the 1.6 bug fixes for 2 common exploits should be mentioned on the page: 1) "Fixed exploit that made it possible to keep temporary items like Qi Fruit by selling them to Pierre and rebuying them the following day." 2) "Fixed exploit that allowed the player to purchase their previously sold artisan goods at a cheaper price the day after changing their profession from Artisan through the use of Statue of Uncertainty." <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Funny_Fox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Funny Fox (page does not exist)">Funny Fox</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Funny_Fox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Funny Fox (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:37, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello again! No apologies are necessary, life interrupts the best plans for all of us sometimes.</dd>
<dd>What you have on your user page is a lot of advice-giving and not really objectively written text. When you remove that, what you have left is basically what's written on the <a href="/Animals" title="Animals">Animals</a> page, which all the animals' pages link to as the main page (<i>i.e.,</i> the "Produce" section is a short summary that links to the main article "<a href="/Animals#Produce" title="Animals">Animals#Produce</a>"). So, I don't think the pages are lacking info, and no changes are necessary.</dd>

<p>I noticed in my game that after the trees are fully grown that you CAN place items next to them and they don't prevent fruit from growing. So I discovered that you can put garden pots in there for more growing space... they can't have ancient fruit in them but it's a good way to get more out of your greenhouse.

<dl><dd>I think the details of what to put in the greenhouse fall under advice-giving, and the fact that objects don't impede fruit trees from increasing in quality is covered on the <a href="/Fruit_Trees" title="Fruit Trees">Fruit Trees</a> page (and the <a href="/Garden_Pot" title="Garden Pot">Garden Pot</a> page).

<p>Hello! I see you was confused by 2 very similar fish names in RU version: Морской еж (Sea Urchin) and Морской ерш (Lionfish) (romanized Morskoy yozh and Morskoy yorsh). This is the main reason I renamed the latter to Крылатка (Krylatka). Also the new name not only help to distinguish these 2 fishes, it is also the correct one because Morskoy yorsh refers to completely different fish: Sea Scorpion.--<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Quicksilver&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Quicksilver (page does not exist)">Quicksilver</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Quicksilver&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Quicksilver (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:45, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Aha! Thank you for the explanation. But I still don't know if any page names need to be changed on the wiki or not -- there are two entries in the table for "Smoked Fish", and there is no page created yet in Russian... 🤔 <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:29, 27 November 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I've fixed the table, it's all within the smoked fish row now. The 'smoked fish' term wasn't changed, it is just custom flavored names which was added to better match the gender of the particular fish ('Копченый {1}' is the default masculine form and if fish has feminine gender, there is an entry for it in this table). Jelly, Juice, Smoked Fish, Dried Fruit, Honey, Pickles, Wine – they all retained its general name which was used before 1.6.9, but name for the particular flavor now can be written more grammatically correct. --<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Quicksilver&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Quicksilver (page does not exist)">Quicksilver</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Quicksilver&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Quicksilver (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:59, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_deleted_sentences_of_my_edit">The deleted sentences of my edit</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean,
</p><p>I'd like to explain my intention of sentences such as "a qualified Goat can produce Large Milk per teo days" and hear your thought🙏
</p><p>I found a similar sentence in <a href="/Void_Egg" title="Void Egg">Void Egg</a> article saying:
<i>The Void Egg is an animal product obtained from a Void Chicken. <b>It produces one Void Egg per day if fed on the prior day, like all other chickens.</b></i>
So I thought other animals' articles should have corresponding sentences, and I tried to add them. Becoming awkward expression is because of my English skill, I think.
</p><p>So now, I'd like to know your thought about it. If such sentences are no longer needed, it has to be removed from Void Egg article; Otherwise, it has to be added to other articles.

</p>
<dl><dd>Hello Mmtraa! Please forgive me for not messaging you first! The problem with your edits was the use of "it" as the subject. The first sentence talks about the animal product, then the next sentence talks about the animal, and the third sentence switches back to the animal product. But the 3rd sentence uses "it" as the subject, so it's not clear whether the "it" means the animal or the egg!</dd>
<dd>The <a href="/Void_Egg" title="Void Egg">Void Egg</a> page suffers from the same problem, but it's not as confused for some reason. I honestly think it would be better to leave the info on the animals' pages, and not on the egg/milk pages, tbh. <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:33, 13 December 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Yes you are completely true on that confusing "it" ! Actually I also had felt this might be matter, but I had no better idea on expression and went with it...</dd>
<dd>Recently I've read the <a href="/Animals" title="Animals">Animals</a> article and each animals' pages, and confirmed all of them refer to the producing cycle. So, I think the sentence about producing cycle on <a href="/Void_Egg" title="Void Egg">Void Egg</a> page could be removed, as you say (because <a href="/Void_Chicken" title="Void Chicken">Void Chicken</a> page certainly has the same information).

This was to mirror exactly what you did in the <a href="/Winter" title="Winter">Winter</a> page with <a class="external text" href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Winter&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=182774" rel="nofollow">your edit</a> for the powdermelon entry, so I thought I would do the same here for consistency (carrot seeds also cannot be bought from Pierre's after all).</dd>
<dd>My next three edits were to make the formatting and order of the data for the coffee bean, unmilled rice, and strawberry entries consistent with the formatting and order seen in <a href="/Summer#Multiple_Harvests" title="Summer">Summer#Multiple Harvests</a>, <a href="/Crops#Unmilled_Rice" title="Crops">Crops#Unmilled Rice</a>, and <a href="/Crops#Strawberry" title="Crops">Crops#Strawberry</a>, and once again to add <code>≈</code> where it was missing.</dd>
<dd>My final edit, where I shortened the text in the strawberry entry, was motivated by how the table looked quite cramped after my other edits, and by how this same information is presented in <a href="/Crops#Strawberry" title="Crops">Crops#Strawberry</a>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Summer</dt>
<dd>My first edit was to also correct the gold/day value of the summer squash value, which presents the completely different value of <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="18"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>18g</span>/d. I also have no idea how that value was obtained, but it too does not seem to follow the formula from <a href="/Crops#Gold_per_Day" title="Crops">Crops#Gold per Day</a>.

<dd>My second edit was also to make the formatting and order of the data in the coffee bean entry consistent with the formatting seen in <a href="/Crops#Coffee_Bean" title="Crops">Crops#Coffee Bean</a>, and once again to add <code>≈</code> where it was missing.</dd></dl>
<p>I hope this makes sense. I marked most of these edits as minor because I didn't think any of them modified the meaning of the article. The only edits that I didn't mark as minor were the ones where I changed the gold/day value for the summer squash in the <a href="/Summer" title="Summer">Summer</a> and <a href="/Crops" title="Crops">Crops</a> pages.

<h2><span id="Fandom_Wiki_Talk,_Mostly"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Fandom_Wiki_Talk.2C_Mostly">Fandom Wiki Talk, Mostly</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean, this is mostly regarding the ancient Fandom Wiki. I apologize for the how lengthy this message is. I get overly-detailed for the sake of context sometimes.
</p><p>2 months ago or so I started playing Stardew Valley and inevitably, I came across this wiki in my search to enhance gameplay and discovery. However, I quickly decided to search for a Fandom Wiki site because I prefer Fandom's web and interface designs. Though I have no idea what this one is like for editors; I just always found super wide wikis with square tables and thin borders everywhere not to my taste. I didn't know Minerva existed until today though...
</p><p>Anyhow, there was a problem: Fandom Wiki was barely updated past 2018. Pre-discovery that the community had moved over to here years ago, I took it upon myself to adopt it and haven't stopped improving it since. Nearly every day, all day. But it occurred to me recently that communities don't simply abandon a project like that to start anew very willingly, and there is more often a painful reason why.
</p><p>So a couple days ago I decided I'll find out why, but I couldn't find any clear answers. If it isn't awful of me to ask nor too-politically-heated of a subject for wiki chatting, may I know the story behind the move? That is if you know why and feel empowered to tell?
</p><p>I really care about this game, and I thought it would be wonderful to help out the Fandom Wiki; myself and others still hang about there. My impression was that people who moved wikis encouraged everyone else too, and I know now about Fandom's policy regarding deleting Wiki's and it wouldn't surprise me if it was a Terms of Use disagreement or something similarly. "Only the ones they decide to delete" will be deleted, creators can't. I read a tiny amount about their user data collection policies, which seemed concerning, but I didn't dive into it.
</p><p>At this point, I've spent SO MUCH TIME making new things for it. Amazing projects I'm quite proud of. New infobox css and templates, table designs, even a new site logo with a photoshop program and pixel-drawing a Lava Monkey icon because I couldn't find one anywhere. I haven't ever done these things before but I'm learning quite fast; I've already dived into CSS styling after a month. I love doing it, for now. But I don't want to be doing it for just my own selfish hyperfixation, particularly if I might be disrespecting, undermining, or disregarding the original wiki creators and any potential hurt ache they went through.
</p><p>So, I came here to explore this wiki a little more than just grabbing some icons. I still can't tolerate the Vector skin, but the MinervaNeue one looks like it could be my cup of Stardrop Tea. It looks rather under-designed, as though it's capbilities for a wonderful styling is large enough. I'm curious if any of my current or future skills could be helpful here and if so, I'd be happy to transfer over my efforts and projects to improve Minerva, if that is even a thing happening. I can also be just as happy continuing my adoption of the Fandom Wiki too, as there are still folks who like it there and would appreciate it.
</p><p>Anyway, that was a lot. I hope you are enjoying your holidays. If you don't celebrate, then I hope your you-time has been wonderful.
</p><p>Take care,

<p>Hi, Margotbean! I didn't know exactly where to send this, so sorry if I should say this in another place.
</p><p>In the Evelyn page (english), the raisins are linked normaly; but in the portuguese version, it links to an unexistent raisins page instead of the "passas" page. When I went to edit the spanish version, it happened the same thing; didn't link to the "pasas" page. I'm new here so I don't know how to fix it. Thanks in advance! <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Venusmorreu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Venusmorreu (page does not exist)">Venusmorreu</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Venusmorreu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Venusmorreu (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:57, 30 December 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The links seem fine, so I'm sorry, I don't understand the problem! <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 23:44, 30 December 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That's actually very weird! Maybe it was just a bug? I added the Woody's Secret to Robin's portuguese page now and it's the same thing that was happening with Evelyn's page, should I just give it time perhaps? <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Venusmorreu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Venusmorreu (page does not exist)">Venusmorreu</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Venusmorreu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Venusmorreu (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:49, 31 December 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
