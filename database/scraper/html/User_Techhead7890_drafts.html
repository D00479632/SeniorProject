<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><div class="mw-parser-output"><ul><li><b>Quality</b> is an attribute of items including <a href="/Crops" title="Crops">crops</a>, <a href="/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, and <a href="/Artisan_Goods" title="Artisan Goods">artisan goods</a>. (<a href="/Trash" title="Trash">Trash</a>, <a href="/Minerals" title="Minerals">minerals</a>, and <a href="/Category:Resources" title="Category:Resources">resources</a> do not have quality). Quality has three levels: silver, gold, and iridium. Higher qualities improve the sale price and the friendship increase from gift-giving.
<ul><li>Improving quality depends on skill and on various other methods related to the item involved:
<ul><li>Crops can be improved by using <a href="/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a> and with <a href="/Farming" title="Farming">farming</a> skill;</li>
<li><a href="/Animals" title="Animals">Animals</a> by care, happiness, and mood; Fruit Trees by annual aging;</li>
<li>Forageables can improve with skill, or be guaranteed iridium quality by the <a href="/Skills#Foraging" title="Skills">Botanist</a> profession.</li>
<li><a href="/Fishing#Fish_Quality" title="Fishing">Fish quality</a> can be improved by fishing further from land and having a perfect catch.</li>
<li>Certain artisan goods can be aged in a <a href="/Cask" title="Cask">cask</a>. Some animal goods provide higher quality output (see <a href="/Animals#Deluxe_and_Large_Products" title="Animals">animal product variants</a>), such as <a href="/Large_Egg" title="Large Egg">Large Eggs</a> resulting in golden <a href="/Mayonnaise" title="Mayonnaise">mayonnaise</a>.</li>
<li>Cooked items can be made gold quality with <a href="/Qi_Seasoning" title="Qi Seasoning">Qi Seasoning</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Quality improves the sale price from 1.0x to 1.25, 1.5x, 2.0x.</li>
<li>In the game's code, each item is assigned a value from zero to four. 0 represents no quality; 1 silver, 2 gold, and with a gap, 4 represents iridium quality.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Shops</b> allow the player to purchase items for <a href="/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a>. Most shops are run by a <a href="/Villagers" title="Villagers">villager</a> and some are reachable by <a href="/Telephone" title="Telephone">telephone</a> to get an overview of their service. While all shops sell items, some shops also allow the player to sell items to them to instantly generate revenue. Shops are affected by the <a href="/Days_of_the_Week" title="Days of the Week">Days of the Week</a>, including their <a href="/Shop_Schedules" title="Shop Schedules">trading hours</a> and stock.
<ul><li>Some shops, particularly in the lategame, only sell items for barter. Namely, these are the <a href="/Desert_Trader" title="Desert Trader">Desert Trader</a> and the <a href="/Island_Trader" title="Island Trader">Island Trader</a>.</li>
<li>Items that cannot be sold to that shop will be greyed out in the inventory.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/Day_Cycle" title="Day Cycle">Time</a>: Time in Stardew Valley is divided into days, <a href="/Days_of_the_Week" title="Days of the Week">weeks</a> and <a href="/Seasons" title="Seasons">seasons</a>. Each day consists of 20 hours, each week of 7 days, and each season of 28 days. As some examples of the days of the week, most villagers will have different routines, moving to different locations around the Valley. Store hours and stock may also be affected. It will also affect what programs are shown on <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a>.</li>
<li><b>Bars</b> are units of metal material used for upgrading, crafting, and construction purposes. They are produced by <i>smelting</i> in a <a href="/Furnace" title="Furnace">furnace</a> using coal and ore. Like many other materials they can be purchased from shops, albeit indirectly, by buying the 5 ore and 1 coal from <a href="/Clint" title="Clint">Clint</a>. For example a <a href="/Copper_Bar" title="Copper Bar">Copper Bar</a> costs 525g (Y1) when purchased in this way, and an <a href="/Iron_Bar" title="Iron Bar">Iron Bar</a> costs 900g ((5+1)*150g  Y1). (It is not worth transmuting purchased bars).</li></ul>
