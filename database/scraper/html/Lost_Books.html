<p>Another mystery of the dwarves is the advanced technology they supposedly possess. Evidence such as this had led me, despite the ridicule of my colleagues, to propose a new theory:
</p><p>I believe the dwarves are the remnants of a once advanced civilization whos interplanetary vehicle crashed on this planet long ago.
</p><p>I propose that this dwarvish spaceship bore down, deep underground... and over time, the dwarves became adapted to their new underground environment.
</p><p>My colleagues ask, 'Why didn't they come above ground and live on the surface?' ...Perhaps their old planet had a thicker atmosphere that protected them from stellar radiation, and they simply could not survive in our sunlight.
</p><p>That would explain why they only surface at night to take what they need from our houses...

<td>The species commonly known as "Goblin" seems to have originated in the forests of the far northeast, beyond the Bluemire Hills. Characterized by their green skin, bright red eyes, and foul smell, initial encounters with Goblins can be frightening for unexperienced travellers.
<p>Despite their unsettling appearance, Goblins possess an intellectual and emotional capacity akin to humans, and have no trouble learning our customs and languages. The goblins I've met have been rather friendly and amiable, once I've shown that I mean no harm. Unfortunately, centuries of distrust and ill-treatment from humans has led many Goblins to pursue careers in the employment of witches, warlocks, necromancers, and other unsavory types.
</p><p>A traditional Goblin diet consists of grub meat, typically from the large and juicy grub varieties native to the Goblin home-forest. On special occasions, Goblins will indulge in an item called '<a href="/Void_Mayonnaise" title="Void Mayonnaise">void mayonnaise</a>'... considered perhaps the finest delicacy in all Goblin cuisine.
