<p>Hello CandyNim!  I have a question about your recent edit to the <a href="/Fishing" title="Fishing">Fishing</a> page, where you commented that you caught more than one Broken Trident -- caught multiples while at least one was in inventory.  The code seems to indicate that this is not a desired event, that is, I think ConcernedApe intended for only one to be caught per fishing session or per save file (I cannot tell which).
</p><p>My question is, what platform are you playing on, and have you updated to the most recent patch of v1.5?  If so, I would like to report this as a bug.  Any other details you can provide would be helpful (single or multiplayer, was this a save started before v1.5, etc.)
</p><p>Thanks very much!  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:15, 2 April 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Okay I have no clue how talk works on wikis but here goes. It was started after 1.5, singleplayer, on mac, I would think the latest version but don't know how to check. Attached below should be a screenshot.</dd>

<dd>Is this good enough? <a href="/User:CandyNim" title="User:CandyNim">CandyNim</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 18:20, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, very helpful, thank you!  You can check the version number from the title screen, by clicking the question mark button in the lower right.  The game version will appear in the lower left.  Before I report the potential bug, I have to be sure you're using the latest version.  Thanks again!  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:59, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's v1.5.4, is that the latest? <a href="/User:CandyNim" title="User:CandyNim">CandyNim</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 19:06, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yep, I have everything I need to report the bug.  Thanks so much!!! <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:08, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Should some note of how "the intended behavior is xyz, but it's currently bugged" be placed there instead? And probably similarly on the broken trident page <a href="/User:CandyNim" title="User:CandyNim">CandyNim</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 19:10, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, I strongly suspect it's a bug, but until ConcernedApe confirms this, we don't need to report it as a bug on the wiki, we can just remove the requirement that you can't have one in inventory to obtain another one.  (This is true for the <a href="/Broken_Trident" title="Broken Trident">Broken Trident</a> and <a href="/Neptune%27s_Glaive" title="Neptune's Glaive">Neptune's Glaive</a>, by the way, the code is exactly the same.)  There's a chance it is a bug, but CA won't think it's important enough to fix, as well, so there's no need for the wiki to mention it.  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:16, 4 April 2021 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have reported the potential bug here:  <a class="external free" href="https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/fishing-treasure-broken-trident-neptunes-glaive.6844/" rel="nofollow">https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/fishing-treasure-broken-trident-neptunes-glaive.6844/</a></dd>
<dd>I'll delete the image from the wiki now.  Thanks again!  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:29, 4 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
