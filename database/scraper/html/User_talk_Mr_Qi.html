<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Seed_Maker_exploits">Seed Maker exploits</span></h2>
<p>I don't think you understood what I meant when I said "Seed Maker output exploits were removed in 1.6." What I meant was that the pattern is no longer easily predictable. For example, part of what I deleted: "it's possible to produce identical output by placing a second Seed Maker 10 tiles left of the first, and then feeding its input 10 minutes after the first is fed." works in 1.5, but does not work in 1.6. (Other similar patterns of Seed Maker outputs were also removed). I never said that the output of the Seed Maker was no longer determined based on the day, location, and time (in fact, I literally kept that part in!). Furthermore, the fact that the output of the Seed Maker is determined based on the day, location, and time is not really an exploit in itself, because if that wasn't the case (if it was completely random, for instance), it would still be possible to save scum outputs by reloading until you get 3 Ancient Seeds from an Ancient Fruit or an Ancient Seed from another crop. In fact, the output being predetermined makes it so that you have to move the Seed Maker around until you get your desired result. <a href="/User:User314159" title="User:User314159">User314159</a> (<a href="/User_talk:User314159" title="User talk:User314159">talk</a>) 03:02, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi there. No, I did not understand what you meant with "Seed Maker output exploits were removed in 1.6.", that is correct. In my opinion, <i>save scumming</i> isn't an exploit, as it is near-impossible to mitigate without breaking the game in so many ways for people who don't do it (in other words, it isn't something anyone <i>should</i> attempt to mitigate). However, by introducing the current real-world timestamp to the initialization seed of the PRNG, ConcernedApe could make it so that no-other method would work, <i>including</i> the "determine the optimal ingame times with several tries, reload, and do a perfect run" method.<br/>Now that you mention it, the part mentioning the location and the time of the seed maker was the reason I originally edited the page, because, outside of the context of someone who read the source (in other words, for nearly anyone curious, which is 99+% of the readers of the page), it means that "a specific location and time of day will produce consistent seed results" (e.g. "Placing it in the basement means that the seed maker will generate 3 seeds in the morning", etc); and this could waste people's time a <i>lot</i> from trying to determine the ideal location and time of the day for seed generation. I have not edited this part yet, because I made mistakes in my initial edits (miscalculation of probabilities, based myself on an old version), and I decided to wait until I had access to the <i>current</i> source code before making new edits. <a href="/User:Mr_Qi" title="User:Mr Qi">Mr Qi</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 15:19, 4 September 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hello! You can avoid the "mass edit by new user" problem by making smaller edits and saving in-between, as described here: <a href="/Help:Editing#New_Editor_Restriction" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing#New Editor Restriction</a>. <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:04, 4 September 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello ;) As far as I can tell, external links are prohibited, no matter how small the edit... But I will check your link in case it says something about external links. Thanks!</dd></dl>
