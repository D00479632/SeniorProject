<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapon_sell_price">Weapon sell price</span></h2>
<p>Hello Jaks!  I'm having trouble finding the sell to store price for weapons.  I noticed you updated a few pages with reduced sell prices, and I would like to record the change in the history section of the pages, if it's a 1.5 change. However, I'm embarrassed to say that I cannot find where the sell price is set in data files or in the code.  Do you have any idea?  Is this a 1.5 change, or was the information incorrect before?  Thanks so much, <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:54, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>not Jaks but I think you just get the formula from MeleeWeapon.cs which states "salePrice itemlevel * 100" and then the shop sell formula is "(toSell.salePrice() / 2", so the summary would be: grab item level, multiply by 100, divide by 2 = sell price. Example Infinity Gravel: item Level 17 * 100 = 1700 /2 = 850g saleprice. <a href="/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 16:53, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks for the info!  Now the question is, where does weapon level get set?  It must be in the code, because it's not in <samp>Weapons.xnb</samp>.  <a href="/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:16, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, I just passed to the wiki what is in the game, I do not see the game files or code. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:JaksStrange&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:JaksStrange (page does not exist)">JaksStrange</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 18:31, 20 March 2021 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am not exactly sure but I THINK it could be just a calculation pulled from all the other weapon attributes. There is a getItemLevel calculation done that takes all kind of attributes and weaponpoints into account and based on that calculation the item level is set. This is my assumption anyway, I am neither a coder nor a modder <a href="/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 19:25, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, thanks for all the info and research, everyone!  I'm going to open a topic on the <a href="/Weapons" title="Weapons">Weapons</a> talk page to continue the discussion, so Jaks doesn't get notified every time someone discovers some new info.

<p>May I learn the reason why <a class="external text" href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Abigail&amp;oldid=120172" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> has been reverted? There's no vandalism. There's no change of information. I made all changes looking into game's files and decompiled source, none of the information is wrong. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:FurkanS1821&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:FurkanS1821 (page does not exist)">FurkanS1821</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:FurkanS1821&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:FurkanS1821 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:15, 5 May 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The way it is currently it is much easier to find what the NPC is doing at any time. I saw your table, and although it saved a lot of information it was very confusing, but if you want to contest this opinion, you can send a message on Abigail talk page to discuss the change you want to make, since it is a big change, and if the administrators approve it will have to be applied to all NPC pages. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:JaksStrange&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:JaksStrange (page does not exist)">JaksStrange</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 22:17, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>If I can throw in my 2 cents: I dislike the change. Not from a logical standpoint, it is probably more "efficient". But from a real use case scenario (my 52y old aunt is currently playing the game and the reason I started editing in the first place) it is less intuitive to look up while playing and is harder to grasp. that's just my opinion and not factually accurate. That being said I do think there are probably ways to display schedules in a better way, but I haven't spent enough time on it to know what it could be <a href="/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 08:49, 6 May 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Fair enough <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:FurkanS1821&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:FurkanS1821 (page does not exist)">FurkanS1821</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:FurkanS1821&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:FurkanS1821 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:57, 6 May 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I've seen it both ways. For example, <a href="/Emily" title="Emily">Emily</a> is a priority list. Both approaches have issues. For a while, there was a web site where you could get schedules just by entering a name and an in-game date, but they took it down rather than update it for 1.5. Don't think anything like that could be easily maintained on the Wiki. <a href="/User:Zendowolf" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Zendowolf" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 00:28, 7 May 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That's actually a pretty good idea. I'll try to make a similar site in my spare time. <a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:FurkanS1821&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:FurkanS1821 (page does not exist)">FurkanS1821</a> (<a class="new" href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:FurkanS1821&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:FurkanS1821 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:07, 7 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi Jaks, you marked a few images for deletion, but they were used on the French wiki.  I actually agree that they were unnecessary images, but remember to check all language wikis before marking something as unused, ok?
