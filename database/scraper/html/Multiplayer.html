<p><b>Multiplayer</b> is an optional game mode in which <a href="#Player_Limit">1–8 players</a> can join the same world through split-screen, over LAN, or by IP address. Multiplayer is available on the PC (Linux/Mac/Windows), console (PS4/Switch/Xbox One) versions and mobile (iOS/Android), but not on PS Vita.
</p><p>The player who created the world is the "host", and the other players are "farmhands". The host has the save file on their system, and can play it in both multiplayer and single-player mode. If the host isn't online or the farm isn't currently open to other players, then farmhands can't access the world or their characters in that world. Farm ownership can't be transferred to farmhands without <a href="/Modding:Index" title="Modding:Index">modding</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Features">Features</span></h2>
<p>Multiplayer mode is mostly identical to singleplayer mode, though certain features are specific to multiplayer only.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Four_Corners_farm_map">Four Corners farm map</span></h3>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a class="image" href="/File:Four_Corners_Farm.png"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" decoding="async" height="300" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c5/Four_Corners_Farm.png/300px-Four_Corners_Farm.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c5/Four_Corners_Farm.png/450px-Four_Corners_Farm.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c5/Four_Corners_Farm.png/600px-Four_Corners_Farm.png 2x" width="300"/></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" href="/File:Four_Corners_Farm.png" title="Enlarge"></a></div>The Four Corners map</div></div></div>
<p>The <a href="/Farm_Maps" title="Farm Maps">Four Corners farm map</a> was designed with multiplayer mode in mind. Each quadrant of the map features a small area for perks from some of the other farm maps to manifest, as well as a tiny pond for players in quadrants besides the quadrant with the large pond to draw water from. However, the Four Corners Map is also available for singleplayer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cabins">Cabins</span></h3>
<dl><dd><i>For cabin placement, see <a href="/Cabin/Cabin_Locations" title="Cabin/Cabin Locations">Cabin Locations</a></i></dd></dl>
<p>The farm can contain up to 3 <a href="/Cabin" title="Cabin">cabins</a> (up to 7 cabins on PC), which are selectable during farm creation. For each cabin built, one player can join the farm. If the farm starts with fewer than 3 cabins (including if the farm was begun as a singleplayer mode save file), Robin can build up to 3 cabins total on the farm for <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="100"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>100g</span> each. Cabin-building is instantaneous, so extra cabins can be built on the first day of the game.
</p><p>The host player can also demolish a cabin at any time. Demolishing a cabin removes its occupant from the game, and places their inventory in a <a href="/Chest" title="Chest">chest</a> located where the cabin was.
</p><p>A cabin can be upgraded at the <a href="/Carpenter%27s_Shop" title="Carpenter's Shop">Carpenter's Shop</a> by the farmhand who occupies it, but not by the host or any other player. The interior layout of an upgraded cabin is identical to the interior of an upgraded farmhouse. As with the farmhouse, the physical footprint of the cabin does not change when upgraded.
</p><p>In order for Robin to upgrade a cabin, the farmhand who occupies it must be present on the farm, if only to sleep through the requisite number of nights.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Profit_margins">Profit margins</span></h3>
<p>When creating a new multiplayer save, a profit margin of 25%, 50%, 75%, or default (100%) can be chosen. Opting to lower the profit margin helps rebalance the economy in multiplayer mode by reducing the gold obtained when selling most items (including crops, forage, minerals, and cooked foods) to account for the increased productivity from the increased number of active players. For example, at 25% profit margin, <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">Wheat</a> is sold for <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="6"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>6g</span> instead of <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="25"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>25g</span>. 
</p><p>Purchase prices for seeds at <a href="/Pierre%27s_General_Store" title="Pierre's General Store">Pierre's General Store</a> and purchase prices for <a href="/Grass_Starter" title="Grass Starter">Grass Starter</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">Sugar</a>, <a href="/Wheat_Flour" title="Wheat Flour">Wheat Flour</a>, and <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">Rice</a> at <a href="/JojaMart" title="JojaMart">JojaMart</a> are scaled with the profit margin set. Prices for other items (including <a href="/Blacksmith" title="Blacksmith">Blacksmith</a> and <a href="/Fish_Shop" title="Fish Shop">Fish Shop</a> shop items, buildings, and tool upgrades) and <a href="/Quests" title="Quests">quest</a> gold rewards are not affected.
</p><p>Lowering the profit margin makes gold much harder to come by in the early game. Progressing in all <a href="/Skills" title="Skills">skills</a> evenly, crafting items, and completing Help Wanted quests become far more important. For example, <a href="/Willy" title="Willy">Willy</a> still sells <a href="/Crab_Pot" title="Crab Pot">Crab Pots</a> for <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="1500"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>1,500g</span> despite the reduced income, so <a href="/Mining" title="Mining">mining</a> iron and <a href="/Crafting" title="Crafting">crafting</a> Crab Pots may be more economical.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marriage">Marriage</span></h3>
<p>Players can marry an NPC, which works <a href="/Marriage" title="Marriage">the same way as single-player</a>. Each NPC can only be married by one player at a time, and children are added to the married player's home.
</p><p>Players can marry another player by giving them a <a href="/Wedding_Ring" title="Wedding Ring">Wedding Ring</a>. Married players get a <a href="/Stardrop" title="Stardrop">Stardrop</a> in a purple giftbox next to their home beds after the wedding (equivalent to the Stardrop received from an NPC spouse). A home is eligible for children if it's owned by one of the married players, has the nursery upgrade, doesn't already have two children, and both players are sleeping in its bed; the game will randomly let one player propose having children to the other, and if accepted, the child will be added to the home that both players are sleeping in (if eligible), else the other player's home (if eligible), else the current home.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplay">Gameplay</span></h3>
<ul><li>Some decisions are made collaboratively by all players by either clicking dialogues or joining areas:
<ul><li>when to sleep, by entering a bed;</li>
<li>when to start a <a href="/Festivals" title="Festivals">festival</a>, by entering the area;</li>
<li>whether to finish the <a href="/Community_Center" title="Community Center">Community Center</a> or buy a Joja membership.</li></ul></li>
<li>All players share the same farmland.  Players may choose to pool their money or split it between each player.</li>
<li>Each player has their own energy bar, their own <a href="/Skills" title="Skills">Skills</a>, and their own relationships with NPCs.</li>
<li>Each player has a separate mailbox and spouse porch area.</li>
<li>Each NPC can only be married by one player. If multiple players want the same spouse, the first to propose will win their hand.</li>
<li>The 14-heart events can only happen one time per NPC in the hosted game. For example, if one player marries an NPC, completes the 14-heart event, and then divorces the NPC and another player marries that NPC they will not be allowed to complete the 14-heart event with the NPC.</li>
<li>Interactions between players:
<ul><li>Players can marry each other and have children. Players propose to each other using a craftable <a href="/Wedding_Ring" title="Wedding Ring">Wedding Ring</a>. The wedding ring recipe can be obtained at the <a href="/Traveling_Cart" title="Traveling Cart">Traveling Cart</a> for <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="500"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>500g</span> , and will then allow the player to craft a wedding ring with 5 Iridium Bars and a Prismatic Shard.</li>
<li>Players can dance with each other in the <a href="/Flower_Dance" title="Flower Dance">Flower Dance</a> Festival (no prior requirements).</li>
<li>Players can see other players’ scores during certain festivals.</li></ul></li>
<li>Players can restore <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> by standing in bed without sleeping.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quests_and_progress">Quests and progress</span></h3>
<ul><li>Quest progress is largely kept on an individual level, though players can help each other with quests.</li>
<li>Quests set difficulty based on the highest-level player.</li>
<li>Mine progress is global, and each player can open chests for themselves (using the elevator to reach required floors also satisfies the mine quests).</li>
<li><a href="/Museum" title="Museum">Museum</a> collection is global, and every player gets their own set of rewards.</li>
<li>The reward for completing the Bulletin Board bundle is applied to all players, although item rewards are only given to the player turning in the bundle.</li>
<li>Completing bundle sets or Joja forms unlocks the final reward for every player. However, only the player who completes a bundle can pick up the reward.
<ul><li>Repairing the bridge at the beach is also global.</li></ul></li>
<li>Each player's tools have to be upgraded individually, though tools can freely be traded between players depending on need. This also eliminates any possible problems of not having a tool available during the upgrade.</li>
<li>Any player can purchase and place buildings on the farm, though only the host can upgrade the farmhouse and cabins can only be upgraded by their owners.
<ul><li>The permission for moving buildings can be changed with a <a href="#Commands">command</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Every player has their own set of <a href="/Stardrop" title="Stardrop">Stardrops</a> to obtain, though most of them will be available once any player meets the requirement.</li>
<li>Recipes for cooking and crafting are obtained individually, though of course players can help each other out.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h3>
<ul><li>Money can be shared between all players or split individually.
<ul><li>This can be set when creating a new game, or enabled and disabled using the "Town Ledger" in the <a href="/Mayor%27s_Manor" title="Mayor's Manor">Mayor's Manor</a>.</li>
<li>If money separation is enabled after the game has started, money will be divided evenly among all players in the game.</li>
<li>To prevent money from being split on a previously single-player farm, activate money separation before the first new farmhand logs in. This results in the farmhand receiving the standard <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="500"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" decoding="async" height="18" src="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" width="18"/>500g</span>.</li>
<li>The "Town Ledger" can send money between players if money is not shared.</li></ul></li>
<li>For each item placed in the <a href="/Shipping" title="Shipping">shipping bin</a>, the price is determined by the <i>online</i> player whose professions would most increase it.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Experience">Experience</span></h3>
<p>Each player has their own <a href="/Skills" title="Skills">experience</a> points. Whoever commits the action will be the one to gain the experience.
</p>
<ul><li>Farming
<ul><li>Whoever harvests a crop gets the experience, regardless of who planted it or any other work done with it.</li>
<li>Whoever interacts with an animal gets the experience.</li></ul></li>
<li>Mining
<ul><li>Whoever gets the last swing with the pickaxe gets the experience. It is not shared.</li>
<li>Whoever set off a <a href="/Crafting#Bombs" title="Crafting">bomb</a> gets experience for destroyed rocks.</li></ul></li>
<li>Foraging
<ul><li>Whoever picks up the forageable gets the experience.</li>
<li>Whoever gets the last swing with the axe when chopping a tree, stump, or log gets the experience. It is not shared.</li></ul></li>
<li>Fishing
<ul><li>Experience for fish is gained for the player who catches it, as expected.</li>
<li>Whoever empties a <a href="/Crab_Pot" title="Crab Pot">crab pot</a> gets the experience, regardless of who set it or baited it.</li></ul></li>
<li>Combat
<ul><li>Whoever kills the monster gets the experience. It is not shared.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Luck">Luck</span></h3>
<ul><li>Players can have different daily <a href="/Luck" title="Luck">luck</a>.</li>
<li>Luck is averaged out between all players for calculations.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Time">Time</span></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, during a day time only pauses while the players attend a festival or when using <code>/pause</code>.<br/>
When hosting a multiplayer game, time will behave as in singleplayer until the first farmhand joins. This means the host can simply keep their inventory or menu open while waiting for another player to join.
</p><p>While in a multiplayer game with 2 or more players time will pause when:
</p>
<ul><li>The day has ended and a player is picking a profession or hasn't closed the shipping report.</li>
<li>The players are attending a festival that includes a main event. (Time will skip to the evening once the festival is left.)</li>
<li>The host has paused the game using <code>/pause</code>. (See below)</li>
<li>The Time reaches 02:00 am and a player is still inside a cutscene. (They will pass out once the cutscene is over.)</li>
<li>The Time reaches 02:00 am and a player still has their inventory or any menu open. (They will pass out once the opened inventory or menu is closed.)</li>
<li>Split-Screen only: If all players are on a menu or a cutscene, time will pause.</li></ul>
<p>In multiplayer, no other circumstances will cause time to pause, skip forward or move at a different rate than normal.
</p><p>In particular time will pass while:
</p>
<ul><li>In any menu, inventory or dialogue.</li>
<li>A shop's inventory is open. (Continuing the trade remains possible even when the NPC has walked away or gone to sleep.)</li>
<li>In a cutscene. (See above. You can see other players while invisible to them. Time is not displayed.)</li>
<li>Playing an Arcade Game.</li>
<li>Reeling in a fish.</li></ul>
<p>Some actions remain possible while the game is manually paused using <code>/pause</code>:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chat">Chat</span></h2>
<p>Chat is a feature that allows communicating between players directly through the in-game chat box. The game will also broadcast messages via the chat box, such as when a player is caught rummaging through trash or has walked a certain number of steps.
</p><p>There are several commands that can be run by players in the chat box to change settings, direct message other players, etc.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Commands">Commands</span></h3>
<p>Commands can be run in the chat box, using a forward slash (<code>/</code>) before the command.

<p>The default limit for farmhands is 7 (8 players total), but can be changed on PC (without having to install any mods) by manually changing the game's config files.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-catweet1_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-catweet1-2">[2]</a></sup> <b>Note that this is experimental and may make the game unstable.</b><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-catweet2_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-catweet2-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>To change the limit, find the following file:

<p>Change the value of <code>&lt;playerLimit&gt;-1&lt;/playerLimit&gt;</code> to the amount of players that you want to allow in your games, such as to <code>&lt;playerLimit&gt;10&lt;/playerLimit&gt;</code> to allow 10 players.
