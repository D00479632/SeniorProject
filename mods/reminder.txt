Because of some software update when you try to use the "install on
macOS.command" it pops up an error and tells you that it cannot be opened
because its from an unidentified developer. To fix this, go into the settings
and under Privacy and Security tab and scroll down, somewhere there should 
be an "Open anyways". Once you have followed these steps just keep following the
instructions on "https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing_SMAPI_on_Mac"
